1
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.718
Look, I’m incredibly proud

2
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:36.138
of my career in the military,
and I did two combat tours,

3
00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:38.222
but, uh, I was never
gonna be a career guy.

4
00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:40.307
I found my passion
in the Army Research Lab.

5
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.728
I used my GI Bill to, uh...
to go to Cal State,

6
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.188
and I’m currently teaching
high school biology.

7
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.024
Okay, Dan. I-I think

8
00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:49.192
Arthur’s still reviewing
the proposal.

9
00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.069
That’s great,
but I have some more data,

10
00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.072
and I’m nearby,
so I-I want to bring

11
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.365
- a new proposal tonight.
- Let me put you on hold.

12
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:02.039
Muri? Muri!

13
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.581
Okay, none of you are my child.

14
00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:05.834
Has anyone seen Muri?

15
00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:07.795
- Coming!
- Grab these. I have a mission.

16
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:09.419
Get those to the kitchen.

17
00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:11.757
- Yes, sir.
- There you are. March.

18
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:13.401
- Great party, Dan.
- Oh, thank you. I appreciate...

19
00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.943
- Your place smells amazing.
- Thank you.

20
00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.218
Things are heating up

21
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:19.014
in this final match
of the World Cup.

22
00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:20.848
Hey, Forester.

23
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:23.078
Sorry, guys. Gonna steal him
for a second. -Hey. Sorry, guys.

24
00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:25.853
We are out of Christmas napkins.

25
00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.105
Okay, we have
"I’m just here for the booze"

26
00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:30.067
or "Happy 70th birthday."

27
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.276
- Go "Happy 70th."
- Yeah.

28
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.485
Babe, I’m on hold right now.

29
00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.756
They’re trying
to track down Arthur.

30
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.156
- Right now?
- This is happening right now.

31
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.490
I am gonna punch you

32
00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:40.286
in your unfortunately
very handsome face.

33
00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:42.704
This is the call, though.

34
00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:44.331
I’m in the final round.

35
00:02:44.413 --> 00:02:46.039
This is real work
in an actual lab.

36
00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.626
It’s my dream.

37
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.550
Well, Muri’s dream is that
you wa... - Hee-haw!

38
00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:52.298
...that you watch the game
with her. -Oh, hi.

39
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.424
Hee-haw!

40
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.259
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

41
00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.343
I promise I’ll be back
before the end of the game.

42
00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:59.513
- Okay?
- All right.

43
00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:02.431
- What’s this?
- Um, that’s...

44
00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:05.978
Your-your dad sent Muri
a Christmas card.

45
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.854
- Can we talk about it tomorrow?
- Hmm.

46
00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:09.563
Babe, we’ll talk about it.

47
00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:11.233
- Daniel.
- What?

48
00:03:11.317 --> 00:03:12.610
We don’t have to talk.

49
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:13.919
He’s just trying to be
a grandpa.

50
00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.068
Well, I think he forfeited

51
00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:16.462
the right to meet
his granddaughter

52
00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:18.782
when he abandoned your husband.

53
00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.324
Hey.

54
00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.492
No one’s eating my tuna Santa.

55
00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:25.288
When I come back,
I’m gonna have a new job,

56
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.042
and I’m gonna eat all of
your tuna Santa.

57
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.752
- Hey, Dan.
- Bye.

58
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.628
- Arthur. Hey, man.
- I’m glad you called.

59
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.548
It’s a very competitive
position.

60
00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:37.300
- Yes, sir.
- And experience is everything.

61
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.301
Well, I have
leadership experience.

62
00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:41.597
I ran combat missions in Iraq.

63
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.307
Does that translate, though?

64
00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.265
It sure comes in handy
teaching high school.

65
00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.019
Listen.

66
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.646
You’re a great candidate.

67
00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.858
The only thing you’re missing is
private sector experience.

68
00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:54.401
Which we have to say is

69
00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:56.086
an important part
of what we’re looking for.

70
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.861
No, guys, guys...

71
00:03:57.947 --> 00:04:01.491
And that’s why we had
to make a tough choice.

72
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.242
We found someone else.

73
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:07.080
His background and education...

74
00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.250
he’s just a better fit for us.

75
00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:11.669
Sorry, Dan.

76
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.752
Good luck.

77
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.427
Yeah.

78
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.521
Of course you’re not the guy.

79
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.941
You are such an idiot.

80
00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:44.242
Sorry.

81
00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.423
What happened?-

82
00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:00.341
We are live in Qatar

83
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.343
for the first World Cup
held in...

84
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.137
You know who Selman Waksman is?

85
00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:06.098
I do.

86
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:13.896
He discovered the vaccine
for tuberculosis.

87
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.314
Really?

88
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.985
Do you know where he found it?

89
00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:19.319
You tell me.

90
00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:21.487
In the dirt with worms and poop.

91
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.410
The extreme heat
of our host city

92
00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.536
makes playing in the summertime
all but impossible.

93
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.831
See these people...

94
00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:32.456
playing soccer up there?

95
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.459
They are the best in the world.

96
00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:36.127
Can you believe that?

97
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.088
- I want to be the best.
- Yeah?

98
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:41.300
Like you are at science.

99
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:45.095
Like I am at science.

100
00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.223
You know what it takes
to be the best.

101
00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:50.100
You got to say to yourself,

102
00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:52.310
"I will do...

103
00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.353
I-I will do..."

104
00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.355
You have to think this.

105
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.608
"...what nobody else
is willing to do."

106
00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.196
Yeah. Right?

107
00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:03.737
Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.288
I am meant to do
something special with my life.

109
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.834
Everything’s gonna be okay, Dad.

110
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.093
Thank you, honey.
That’s very sweet of you.

111
00:06:26.927 --> 00:06:28.721
Although I’m pretty sure

112
00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.473
it’s supposed to be me
telling you that

113
00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.225
and not the other way around.

114
00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:33.600
And here’s the corner kick.

115
00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.228
This could be it. It’s coming...

116
00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:36.939
And it’s knocked away
by the goalie.

117
00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:38.816
Oh, and it’s a bicycle kick!

118
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.235
- Dad, watch.
- Wait a minute!

119
00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:42.819
He’s heading down the pitch.

120
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.362
He’s alone,
only one defender behind him.

121
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.406
He’s driving towards it.
It’s unbelievable!

122
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.283
Can he do it? Yes, he can!

123
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.201
50 to 60 armed men and women

124
00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.161
standing on the pitch.

125
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.886
- You’re tapped in.
- Good copy.

126
00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.180
It’s okay.

127
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.812
We are you,

128
00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:01.732
30 years in the future.

129
00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.149
It’s okay, sweetie.

130
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.276
We are fighting a war.

131
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.778
Our enemy is not human.

132
00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:11.199
And we are losing.

133
00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:15.536
In 11 months’ time,
all human beings in the future

134
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.081
will be wiped
from the face of the earth

135
00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:23.252
unless you help us.

136
00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.463
We need you.

137
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:31.677
Our fathers, mothers
and grandparents,

138
00:08:31.762 --> 00:08:35.889
we need you to fight beside us

139
00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:38.600
if we stand a chance
at winning this war.

140
00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:40.312
Is this a joke?

141
00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:42.812
You...

142
00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:46.024
are our last hope.

143
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.786
12 months ago, we had no idea
how those words

144
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.245
would change everything
about our daily lives.

145
00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.206
Immediately, jump facilities

146
00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:02.042
were established
around the globe

147
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.125
to send the world’s military
into the future

148
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.546
and help fight the Whitespikes.

149
00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.298
The first thousand
soldiers are headed

150
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.341
- 28 years into the future.
- Five, four, three...

151
00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:13.134
We’ll be anxiously awaiting
their return. -...two, one.

152
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.178
Seven days later,
those hopes were dashed

153
00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:18.014
as only a handful
of troops survived.

154
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.519
Since only 50% of the military
are qualified to jump,

155
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.730
civilians were needed
to support the war effort,

156
00:09:23.812 --> 00:09:25.691
so the world’s leaders agreed

157
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.485
to institute the first
worldwide draft.

158
00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:30.235
Yesterday, they were civilians.

159
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.779
- We are you.
- But today, they are soldiers.

160
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.158
But even with
thousands of civilian soldiers

161
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.158
being sent a week,
the future global population

162
00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:41.163
is currently estimated
to be less than 500,000.

163
00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.167
And with a draftee survival rate
of less than 20%,

164
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.543
is it worth it?

165
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:49.504
The antiwar movement continues
to gain momentum.

166
00:09:49.587 --> 00:09:51.883
There are riots and protests
happening all over the world.

167
00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:54.206
What are we supposed to do?
Just throw up our hands, say,

168
00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:55.802
"Sorry you’re dying"?

169
00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:58.181
But why should we still
be fighting a war that,

170
00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.908
as far as we’re concerned,
hasn’t even happened?

171
00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.350
These are our children

172
00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.186
and our grandchildren
that are dying.

173
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.769
We can’t just stand by
and allow them

174
00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:06.565
to be wiped off
the face of the earth.

175
00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.481
That’s why we need to draft
more civilians.

176
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:09.860
We need people to fight,

177
00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.860
but we also need people
to solve the problem.

178
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.489
We need to do everything we can
to stop the aliens now.

179
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.700
This may be our last chance
to save the human race.

180
00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.658
Please don’t let them draft you.

181
00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:20.287
Please don’t let them take you.

182
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.288
I think you had
a bad dream, honey.

183
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.975
MURI Don’t let them
take you. Please don’t...

184
00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:25.542
It’s okay. Just breathe.

185
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.125
It’s okay.-

186
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.586
Just breathe. Deep breaths.
Right, Daddy?

187
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.005
Yeah. In...

188
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.010
Yeah. Yeah.

189
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.014
Breathing brings what

190
00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:40.682
- into your bloodstream?
- Oxygen.

191
00:10:40.764 --> 00:10:42.307
Oxygen. Very good.

192
00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.933
You need oxygen.

193
00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.812
Oxygen feeds your...?

194
00:10:45.894 --> 00:10:47.062
Brain.

195
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.940
- To your brain.
- It’s too easy.

196
00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:50.567
It’s too easy?

197
00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:51.942
All right.

198
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.363
The process of respiration
turns oxygen into what?

199
00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.907
Um, carbon dioxide.

200
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.325
What’s carbon dioxide
also called?

201
00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:04.831
Maybe you need
a physical challenge.

202
00:11:04.913 --> 00:11:06.792
How about this?

203
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.543
Why don’t you try to squeeze me
as hard as you can?

204
00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:11.129
See if you can hurt me.

205
00:11:11.211 --> 00:11:13.465
Mm.-

206
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:18.595
No, no, not hard...
not-not that hard.

207
00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.096
If you open your books
to page 47,

208
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:24.350
talking about photosynthesis
and the magic of chlorophyll.

209
00:11:24.432 --> 00:11:25.769
It’s, uh...

210
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.288
It’s really interesting stuff,
guys. It’s kind of...

211
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.480
They say magic, you know,

212
00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:30.166
it’s not like pulling
a rabbit out of a hat,

213
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.109
but it’s magic,
if you think about it.

214
00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.860
The stuff we breathe out,
a tree breathes in?

215
00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:38.072
I know, you guys are speechless

216
00:11:38.154 --> 00:11:41.033
’cause it’s...
it’s so captivating.

217
00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:54.712
All right, well...

218
00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:56.278
you want to talk
about something else,

219
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.219
let’s talk about something else.

220
00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.513
What gets you excited?

221
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.889
Anybody.
What do you want to talk about?

222
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.687
Anyone?

223
00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:14.024
Really? Anyone.

224
00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:15.652
Anyone in the class
besides Martin?

225
00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.582
Class, what does Martin want
to talk about?

226
00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.322
Ancient volcanoes.

227
00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.990
Ancient volcanoes.

228
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.369
Volcanoes are
nature’s fury, guys.

229
00:12:24.451 --> 00:12:27.245
Yes, which you demonstrated
graphically

230
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.748
at the last science fair.

231
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:29.956
What’s the point?

232
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.586
- What’s the point of what?
- Anything.

233
00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:34.586
School, grades, college...
it’s all bullshit.

234
00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:38.048
Yeah. We’ve seen
the new number projections.

235
00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:42.010
We lose, period.

236
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.971
The aliens kill us all.

237
00:12:44.053 --> 00:12:45.849
Those are numbers
from the year 2051.

238
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.308
- That’s 30 years from now.
- So?

239
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:53.773
They’re taking thousands
of people every week.

240
00:12:53.855 --> 00:12:57.027
My uncle, Tina’s mom.

241
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.778
They’re gone, man.

242
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.363
Listen, guys.

243
00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:04.033
I know it seems pretty bad.

244
00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:07.076
But if there’s one thing
that the world needs right now,

245
00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:09.331
it’s scientists.

246
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.043
We cannot stop innovating.

247
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:16.129
That’s how you solve a problem.

248
00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:18.673
Science is important.

249
00:13:18.755 --> 00:13:21.051
So we need to focus up.

250
00:13:30.183 --> 00:13:31.937
Not our war! Not our war!

251
00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:43.404
- James Daniel Forester Junior.
- Yes.

252
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.908
You go by James or Jim?

253
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.158
I go by Dan, middle name.

254
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:48.912
- Birth certificate, passport?
- Yeah.

255
00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.705
Uh, the...
it should be in there.

256
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.413
Uh, as-as well as
my employment contract.

257
00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.667
Can you have a seat, please?

258
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.750
- Just, uh, over there.
- Sure.

259
00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.254
Thank you.

260
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.547
Remove your shirt, please.

261
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:59.879
- Remove my shirt?
- Mm.

262
00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:02.133
Hey, what is this for?

263
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:05.802
It’s just a test.

264
00:14:15.687 --> 00:14:18.692
Little extra tight, probably,
but that’s fine.

265
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:21.528
Oh, a seat belt. Okay.

266
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.071
Oh, is it a driving test?

267
00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:24.739
It is not.

268
00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:27.240
No? You don’t have jokes
in the future?

269
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.494
Do you have any children,
Mr. Forester?

270
00:14:29.576 --> 00:14:30.912
- Look up.
- I have a daughter.

271
00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.038
I don’t see
her birth certificate.

272
00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.331
- It’s not there?
- No.

273
00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:35.834
You... I’m not... didn’t...

274
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.519
I didn’t know you needed
her birth certificate.

275
00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.296
It’s not required.
However, if you are

276
00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.962
- to die in action...
- Arms straight.

277
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.317
...your dependents will receive
a pretax payment of $1 million.

278
00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.302
I’d assume you’d want us

279
00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:47.052
to verify exactly
who your family is.

280
00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:48.239
Yeah. Well, hold on
a second here.

281
00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.346
You’re gonna feel
a cold sensation.

282
00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.850
What is this test?
What are you testing?

283
00:15:00.356 --> 00:15:02.027
What are you whispering?

284
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:07.157
Mr. Forester...

285
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.200
you’ve been elevated
to Active-2 status.

286
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:10.533
What?

287
00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:13.120
You meet all requirements
for conscription.

288
00:15:13.202 --> 00:15:15.057
Wh-What... what are the
requirements for conscription?

289
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.416
A pulse?

290
00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.629
It says, at 11:23 Eastern Time,

291
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:24.548
October 13, 2030,

292
00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:26.301
you’ll be pronounced dead.

293
00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:32.474
It-it says that I die
in seven years?

294
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.518
- Bite down.
- How do I die?

295
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.854
We can’t share that
information, sir. -But you know?

296
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.248
You’ll really want
to bite down on this

297
00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.581
if you want to keep
from severing your tongue.

298
00:15:40.605 --> 00:15:41.875
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
One more, one more...

299
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.817
Can you please comply
and bite down, sir?

300
00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:46.221
Get your hand out of my face,
or I’ll bite your finger off.

301
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.822
Hold on a second.

302
00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.667
Can we just slow this down
for just a second?

303
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.036
H-Hold on, hold on, hold on.-

304
00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.702
Can we just slow down
one second? I...

305
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:17.519
This device facilitates your
jump to and from the future war.

306
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.729
It is synched
to your unique biosignature

307
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:22.565
and can only be removed when
your tour of duty is complete.

308
00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:25.402
The Jump-band allows us
to track you anywhere on Earth.

309
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:29.529
Any attempt to evade the draft
or tamper with the device

310
00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.740
will result in your imprisonment

311
00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.451
or your spouse
or dependent of legal age

312
00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.202
taking your place.

313
00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.831
You have 24 hours to get
your personal affairs in order

314
00:16:38.913 --> 00:16:40.750
and report for basic training.

315
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.586
Do you have any questions?

316
00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.216
You’re free to go.

317
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.150
I see you were a squad leader
in the Army Special Ops Command?

318
00:17:05.231 --> 00:17:07.192
In Iraq?

319
00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:09.068
Yeah, 15 years ago.

320
00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.450
Thank you for your service.

321
00:17:13.531 --> 00:17:15.366
Again.

322
00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:21.539
Who wants to tell me
what they remember?

323
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.211
About your seven days.

324
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.297
Anyone?

325
00:17:32.049 --> 00:17:33.551
Terry.

326
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.932
You want to tell us anything
you remember?

327
00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.768
The clicking.

328
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:45.940
God, I still can’t get the sound
out of my head.

329
00:17:46.022 --> 00:17:49.527
One starts it, and then
the rest just chime in.

330
00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:53.279
That’s when you realize...

331
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.031
they’re never gonna stop.

332
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.076
Not until we’re all dead.

333
00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.548
Do you know how many
of these guys come back?

334
00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.469
30%... 30% of draftees return.

335
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.346
I talk to them every day,
and they suffer

336
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.056
so much post-trauma
they can barely talk.

337
00:18:19.096 --> 00:18:20.642
I mean, I-I can see why
you don’t work

338
00:18:20.723 --> 00:18:21.884
in the recruiting department.

339
00:18:21.933 --> 00:18:23.559
We’re gonna run.

340
00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:24.813
Come here.

341
00:18:24.894 --> 00:18:26.230
We’re gonna run.

342
00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.480
This is what we’re doing.

343
00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.106
You, me and Muri,
we have to run.

344
00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.169
We have 24 hours. I don’t know
how to run from the government.

345
00:18:31.192 --> 00:18:32.737
You know someone who does.

346
00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:35.905
No.

347
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.784
We have to. Dan.

348
00:18:37.865 --> 00:18:39.661
I’m not asking him
for a goddamn thing.

349
00:18:39.742 --> 00:18:41.077
Do not ask for yourself.

350
00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.873
Ask for me. Ask for me, Dan.

351
00:18:45.414 --> 00:18:47.585
Ask for Muri.

352
00:19:10.106 --> 00:19:11.651
Hello?

353
00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.159
What, are you gonna shoot me?

354
00:19:20.241 --> 00:19:22.368
I didn’t recognize you.

355
00:19:22.451 --> 00:19:25.832
Must’ve been that metrosexual
scruffle you got there.

356
00:19:25.913 --> 00:19:27.959
I mean, grow a beard or don’t.

357
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.544
Oh, it’s my beard?

358
00:19:29.625 --> 00:19:31.226
That’s the reason
you don’t recognize me?

359
00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:35.884
- You got a new accessory, huh?
- You, too.

360
00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:37.675
Desert Eagle .50 cal.

361
00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:39.095
That’s cool.

362
00:19:39.176 --> 00:19:41.012
Yeah, it does the job.

363
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:46.434
The job of convincing the world
you have a small dick?

364
00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.605
- Oh, what’s this?
- You like that?

365
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.941
That’s like the big-boy version
of that windup toy

366
00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.651
- you drove in.
- That yours?

367
00:19:53.733 --> 00:19:56.944
Yep. Got a Bullitt Mustang
parked around back, too.

368
00:19:57.989 --> 00:19:59.405
Before your time, I guess.

369
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.409
Let me see it.

370
00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.954
C-Series.

371
00:20:07.038 --> 00:20:08.875
Second generation.

372
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.002
That’s sensor-calibrated
to your pulse.

373
00:20:17.673 --> 00:20:18.884
Fortunately...

374
00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:24.722
...you came to the only guy for
whom this is a piece of cake.

375
00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:27.226
I wish you wouldn’t drink
while you do this.

376
00:20:27.308 --> 00:20:29.769
I wish Stevie Nicks would
show up in her birthday suit

377
00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:32.315
with a jar of pickles
and a bottle of baby oil.

378
00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:35.567
What?

379
00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.568
Yeah, don’t-don’t overthink it.

380
00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:40.740
So, what made you come to me?
I get a good Yelp review?

381
00:20:41.781 --> 00:20:43.785
Come on.
I know what you do here.

382
00:20:43.866 --> 00:20:45.536
You have a master’s degree
in engineering

383
00:20:45.618 --> 00:20:47.538
and a general disdain
for the U.S. government,

384
00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:49.832
not to mention
no visible means of income.

385
00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:51.250
What do you mean?

386
00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.000
I fix planes for this rich guy.

387
00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.211
He’s got a C-130 out there.

388
00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.298
Yeah, I’m sure that’s
how you can afford a Jeep

389
00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:59.884
and that Desert Eagle,
high roller.

390
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.394
Are you checking to see
if I’m wearing a wire?

391
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.019
Yeah.
The thought occurred to me.

392
00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.521
Oh.

393
00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.400
You come here, surprise visit,

394
00:21:15.481 --> 00:21:18.067
talking about my distrust
of the federal government

395
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.694
and my "no visible means
of income."

396
00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.195
Yeah, that sounds
like entrapment.

397
00:21:21.278 --> 00:21:22.615
Is that entrapment?

398
00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.490
Is that what that sounds like,
Perry Mason?

399
00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:27.368
Is that ’cause you binge-watch
The Sopranos in your trailer?

400
00:21:27.451 --> 00:21:29.203
You think I’m gonna
get out of the draft

401
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.457
if I give the government you?

402
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.255
There’s gonna be... some Feds are
gonna come out of your Jeep.

403
00:21:37.336 --> 00:21:39.382
Did you catch that, guys?

404
00:21:39.463 --> 00:21:41.173
Send in Stevie Nicks.

405
00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.634
Why else would you come here?
Huh?

406
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.846
You never wanted my help
a day in your life.

407
00:21:47.847 --> 00:21:50.182
What did you just say to me?

408
00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:53.563
There were years...

409
00:21:53.644 --> 00:21:55.855
decades...

410
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.982
That was all we wanted from you,

411
00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.817
was a little bit of help.

412
00:22:07.616 --> 00:22:09.537
I could’ve used help...

413
00:22:09.618 --> 00:22:11.328
burying your wife.

414
00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:15.334
Let me tell you something.

415
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:20.923
You have no idea what went on
between your mother and me.

416
00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:24.300
When I got back from Nam,

417
00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:26.095
I was in a very...

418
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:29.346
...dark place.

419
00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:32.643
And I...

420
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.980
I couldn’t find a way out.

421
00:22:37.521 --> 00:22:41.192
I couldn’t get away
from my anger and my violence.

422
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.322
I couldn’t control myself.

423
00:22:44.403 --> 00:22:46.699
I couldn’t even
recognize myself.

424
00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:55.664
dangerous.

425
00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:58.626
You’ve been mad at me
your whole life

426
00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:00.377
’cause I left you,

427
00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:02.381
but I’m telling you,

428
00:23:02.463 --> 00:23:06.134
it would’ve been worse
for you and your mom

429
00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:07.885
if I’d have stayed.

430
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.305
No.

431
00:23:09.386 --> 00:23:11.682
You didn’t leave for us.

432
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:18.105
You quit,
because you’re a coward.

433
00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.651
And you still are.

434
00:23:21.732 --> 00:23:24.487
Stop sending Christmas cards
to my house.

435
00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:27.990
You’re never gonna know Muri.

436
00:23:29.156 --> 00:23:31.160
You don’t get a second chance.

437
00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:49.220
...allowed to take $400
out at once from the ATM,

438
00:23:49.301 --> 00:23:53.015
but if we get out of town...

439
00:23:53.097 --> 00:23:54.557
What? Hi.

440
00:23:54.642 --> 00:23:56.018
You okay?

441
00:24:04.733 --> 00:24:06.903
I don’t know what’s gonna
happen to me if I go,

442
00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:09.905
but you and I both know
what will happen to all of us

443
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.490
if I stay.

444
00:24:11.576 --> 00:24:13.701
We’ll figure it out together.

445
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:15.621
I know how to do this.

446
00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:18.249
It’s seven days. I’ll survive.

447
00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:19.750
I’m a pretty tough guy.

448
00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:22.836
You’re tough? The man who cries
through every cold?

449
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.962
Yeah.

450
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:27.884
You have to tell her.

451
00:24:37.602 --> 00:24:39.519
What you doing?

452
00:24:39.604 --> 00:24:42.021
Looking for vaccines.

453
00:24:42.105 --> 00:24:44.192
Oh. You find any?

454
00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:46.277
Not really.

455
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.739
Digging’s hard.

456
00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.530
Oh, see, it’s about, uh...

457
00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:53.910
You’re doing the...
It’s right what you’re doing

458
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:56.037
with your foot...
you got to give it the weight...

459
00:24:56.118 --> 00:24:58.204
but then you got to use...

460
00:24:58.288 --> 00:24:59.874
What’s this?

461
00:24:59.957 --> 00:25:01.584
- Leverage.
- Leverage.

462
00:25:01.665 --> 00:25:03.920
Son of a bitch.

463
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:06.672
- You did that.
- Oh, hey. Shit.

464
00:25:06.756 --> 00:25:09.423
That’s supposed to be buried
deeper than that.

465
00:25:11.675 --> 00:25:13.636
I’ll give you ten dollars
if you tell your mom

466
00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:15.221
that you cut that cable, not me.

467
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.018
- 20.
- 20?

468
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:20.559
All right.

469
00:25:20.644 --> 00:25:22.019
Fist-bump on it.

470
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:23.689
There you go.

471
00:25:28.653 --> 00:25:30.488
So, uh...

472
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.784
So, listen, Chickpea.

473
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:37.993
I got to go on a trip.

474
00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:43.584
Be gone for about a week.

475
00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:48.047
You got drafted.

476
00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:53.259
Yeah.

477
00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:56.887
Yeah.

478
00:25:59.723 --> 00:26:01.058
Hey, hey, hey.

479
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:02.644
It’s okay.

480
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.438
Don’t worry.

481
00:26:07.481 --> 00:26:09.317
I want you to know something.

482
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:12.528
I will be back.

483
00:26:14.905 --> 00:26:16.534
Okay.

484
00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:21.747
You know I love you, Chickpea.

485
00:26:28.296 --> 00:26:30.423
You people...

486
00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.089
you all have something
in common.

487
00:26:33.968 --> 00:26:36.971
Whatever your age, occupation,

488
00:26:37.054 --> 00:26:40.057
ethnicity or gender,

489
00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:42.308
whatever your background,

490
00:26:42.393 --> 00:26:44.478
you are now heroes.

491
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.396
You answered a call.

492
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.401
It was a cry for help
across time.

493
00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:53.612
It’s the voice
of your children...

494
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:57.240
...and they need you.

495
00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:03.497
The sacrifice that you make now
is for them.

496
00:27:04.788 --> 00:27:06.790
For the first time
in human history,

497
00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:08.919
the armed forces
from every nation

498
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:10.961
are united against one enemy.

499
00:27:11.047 --> 00:27:13.173
I’m Sergeant Diaz.

500
00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:15.134
I am not your friend.

501
00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:17.219
This is.

502
00:27:17.303 --> 00:27:19.180
Seven days from now,
when you are sent

503
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:20.981
- into that war...
- Wrap it around tighter.

504
00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:22.616
...you won’t be fighting
for your country.

505
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.058
Open the chamber, please.

506
00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:25.434
You’ll be fighting
for the world.

507
00:27:27.355 --> 00:27:30.147
I need to see
your weapon’s been cleared.

508
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.486
Throats and abdomens...
that’s what you aim for.

509
00:27:33.567 --> 00:27:35.488
On behalf of
the Department of Defense...

510
00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:38.699
...and a grateful nation...

511
00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:43.702
...we thank you
for your service.

512
00:27:43.788 --> 00:27:45.454
Lieutenant Hart.

513
00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:49.291
Your tour of duty
will be seven days.

514
00:27:49.375 --> 00:27:52.961
That’s 168 hours.

515
00:27:53.047 --> 00:27:55.007
At the end of your tour,

516
00:27:55.089 --> 00:27:57.800
if the Jump-band attached
to your arm determines

517
00:27:57.884 --> 00:27:59.804
that you are still
clinically alive...

518
00:27:59.885 --> 00:28:01.346
Are there any doctors?

519
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.807
...you will automatically
be jumped back

520
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:05.432
from wherever you are,

521
00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:08.560
and your tour of duty
will be complete.

522
00:28:08.644 --> 00:28:12.775
What you think you know about
basic training does not apply.

523
00:28:12.856 --> 00:28:15.567
You will not march,
crawl or climb.

524
00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:18.364
There will be no push-ups,
no pull-ups,

525
00:28:18.445 --> 00:28:20.074
no obstacle courses.

526
00:28:20.155 --> 00:28:22.366
I was kind of
looking forward to that.

527
00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:23.701
You will take

528
00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:26.122
what you are given
and dress as quickly as you can.

529
00:28:26.203 --> 00:28:28.958
Overly ventilated jeans,

530
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.291
yoga pant fails,

531
00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:35.087
cargo shorts...
all will be replaced.

532
00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:36.548
See, I don’t get
the criteria for,

533
00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:37.967
like, what goes and what stays.

534
00:28:38.048 --> 00:28:39.568
Like, they took my shorts,
they left the jacket,

535
00:28:39.593 --> 00:28:41.195
which is clearly, like,
fashion over function.

536
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.262
My man over there is wearing
a chef’s hat.

537
00:28:43.346 --> 00:28:45.722
I mean, I didn’t get this...
This isn’t military issue.

538
00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:47.535
I bought this at
Ross Dress for Less for like $30

539
00:28:47.558 --> 00:28:49.286
’cause I thought it was
gonna be cold in the van.

540
00:28:49.309 --> 00:28:52.980
Most of you will deploy
with D-Force.

541
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:56.192
The rest will jump with R-Force.

542
00:28:56.277 --> 00:28:58.903
The screen on your Jump-band
indicates deployment.

543
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:01.365
Check it now.-

544
00:29:02.825 --> 00:29:05.536
Oh. I guess we’re together.

545
00:29:05.617 --> 00:29:06.952
I’m Charlie.

546
00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:08.663
Dan.

547
00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.749
- How are you?
- Hey. R-Force.

548
00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:12.334
You can braid
each other’s hair later.

549
00:29:12.416 --> 00:29:13.711
All right, stop talking.

550
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:14.961
Listen.

551
00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:16.547
Totally. Uh, sorry.

552
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.507
I-I mean, when I’m nervous,
I talk, and...

553
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:22.470
On a scale of one to ten,

554
00:29:22.553 --> 00:29:24.221
I’m like a 97
on the nervous scale.

555
00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:26.265
Or maybe a... like a 98.

556
00:29:26.346 --> 00:29:27.766
You look like a murderer.

557
00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:30.309
No offense. Well...

558
00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:31.644
- I mean, you do, so...
- Hey.

559
00:29:31.729 --> 00:29:32.997
Hmm? -He will kill you
before the aliens do.

560
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.123
I know.
I called him a murderer.

561
00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:36.066
- T-Turn around, man.
- I am.

562
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.442
Does anyone have any questions?

563
00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:38.817
I missed all of that.

564
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:42.198
You know that guy
in the red shirt?

565
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.825
His name’s Dorian.

566
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:47.868
He’s one of the sole survivors
of the first jump to Russia.

567
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:50.788
This is his third tour.

568
00:29:50.873 --> 00:29:52.625
What?

569
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:55.125
Yeah. You see that claw
around his neck?

570
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:56.670
That is supposed to be from

571
00:29:56.752 --> 00:29:59.381
one of the first Whitespikes
ever killed.

572
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:02.634
He’s flipping us off.

573
00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:04.259
I think she’s flipping you off.

574
00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:05.971
She? Oh.

575
00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:08.472
- That’s my bad.
- What’d you do before all this?

576
00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:10.726
Well, I was department chair
at Georgia Tech.

577
00:30:10.807 --> 00:30:13.435
Doctorate in Earth
and Atmospheric Sciences.

578
00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:17.022
Now I’m director of R and D
at Wallace Technology.

579
00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:18.275
We’re the fastest-growing

580
00:30:18.357 --> 00:30:19.817
geothermal energy company
in the U.S.

581
00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:21.403
Oh, wow.

582
00:30:22.778 --> 00:30:24.949
Okay, so I have, like, a theory.

583
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.740
Mm-hmm.

584
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.826
Have you noticed how all of us...

585
00:30:28.911 --> 00:30:30.953
or at least most of us...

586
00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:32.329
are, like, over 40?

587
00:30:33.413 --> 00:30:35.040
Yeah. You’re thinking that,

588
00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:36.750
in order for the time jump
to occur,

589
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.336
we have to be dead in the time
we’re jumping to?

590
00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:42.673
I mean, I imagine it’s to...
to avoid some sort of paradox.

591
00:30:42.758 --> 00:30:44.174
Which would lead me to believe

592
00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:46.426
that’s why the people
training us are so young.

593
00:30:49.096 --> 00:30:50.891
They haven’t been born yet.

594
00:30:50.973 --> 00:30:53.143
I think we’re
gonna be best friends.

595
00:30:53.227 --> 00:30:54.769
Welcome to R-Force,

596
00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:56.980
also known as Research Force.

597
00:30:57.064 --> 00:30:59.525
You’ll be joining
your counterparts in 2051

598
00:30:59.606 --> 00:31:01.402
at a fortified
research facility.

599
00:31:01.483 --> 00:31:03.403
Your function is to add

600
00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:05.445
your knowledge
and skill set to theirs

601
00:31:05.529 --> 00:31:07.990
- and prevent our extinction.
- Excuse me.

602
00:31:08.075 --> 00:31:10.492
Why don’t we just jump back
to earlier in the war?

603
00:31:10.576 --> 00:31:12.997
The Jumplink doesn’t
work that way.

604
00:31:13.078 --> 00:31:14.078
Jumplink?

605
00:31:14.123 --> 00:31:16.083
It’s the temporal
displacement device

606
00:31:16.164 --> 00:31:18.669
housed in a fortified location
in the middle of the ocean,

607
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.086
and it’s what makes
all your armbands work.

608
00:31:21.171 --> 00:31:23.757
Time only flows
in one direction.

609
00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:25.467
It’s like a river.

610
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:29.680
The Jumplink placed two rafts
on that river, 30 years apart.

611
00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:32.141
Now, we can jump
back and forth between them,

612
00:31:32.222 --> 00:31:34.433
but both rafts will always
keep moving forward.

613
00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:38.188
So, why can’t we just build
more rafts?

614
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.190
The Jumplink tech
is held together

615
00:31:40.272 --> 00:31:42.692
with chewing gum
and chicken wire.

616
00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:46.903
We’ve barely managed to make
one very rudimentary wormhole.

617
00:31:46.989 --> 00:31:48.669
If we weren’t in
an extinction-level event,

618
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.451
we’d still be jumping lab rats.

619
00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:53.368
Now, we can jump you to 2051,
and we can jump you back.

620
00:31:53.452 --> 00:31:54.788
Period.

621
00:31:54.872 --> 00:31:57.958
Every six days,
the Whitespikes disappear.

622
00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.210
They crawl back
into their nests.

623
00:32:00.294 --> 00:32:02.211
We call it the Sabbath.

624
00:32:02.296 --> 00:32:03.881
Their day of rest.

625
00:32:03.962 --> 00:32:06.133
And that’s when
we insert troops.

626
00:32:06.214 --> 00:32:08.719
Okay, but why don’t we have
pictures or video?

627
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.136
You know, it would help us
to know what we’re up against.

628
00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:14.266
The consensus was that
if the public saw

629
00:32:14.348 --> 00:32:16.477
what they’d face
when they reach the future,

630
00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:20.064
it would become virtually
impossible to fill that hangar.

631
00:32:20.145 --> 00:32:22.230
Okay, cool.

632
00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:25.361
Next time someone asks that,
you should probably just lie.

633
00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:28.028
Oh, come on, man.

634
00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:29.780
Palms together.
Take a breath in.

635
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:31.325
And then exhale.-

636
00:32:31.406 --> 00:32:33.617
Bring your hands
through that center.

637
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:34.951
Close your eyes.

638
00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:37.288
Small breath in and out.

639
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.211
I mean, out of all this stuff,

640
00:32:42.294 --> 00:32:44.797
you couldn’t put one thing
of floss in here?

641
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.673
What’s up, man?

642
00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:48.233
- You doing all right?
- Oh, no, yeah.

643
00:32:48.258 --> 00:32:49.593
No, I’m-I’m good.

644
00:32:50.634 --> 00:32:52.554
Going to war.

645
00:32:52.636 --> 00:32:56.266
But you survived jellyfish
season, so you can survive this.

646
00:32:57.518 --> 00:32:59.103
- The shirt.
- Shirt.

647
00:33:00.894 --> 00:33:02.521
You know, actually, I didn’t.

648
00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:05.401
My wife got this for me
as a joke

649
00:33:05.482 --> 00:33:08.112
’cause I got stung
so many times.

650
00:33:08.193 --> 00:33:10.195
I... I hate...

651
00:33:10.278 --> 00:33:12.199
I hate the beach.

652
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.826
I hate it.

653
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:16.576
My wife, of course,
she loves it.

654
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.207
We went this summer
right before she...

655
00:33:24.376 --> 00:33:28.048
She, uh... she got sent out
in the first wave.

656
00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:31.884
I’m really sorry.

657
00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:33.804
Yeah.

658
00:33:33.885 --> 00:33:35.887
Uh, how about you, man?

659
00:33:35.971 --> 00:33:37.391
You got a family?

660
00:33:37.472 --> 00:33:38.932
All right, people!

661
00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.560
Let’s go! This is not a drill!

662
00:33:41.644 --> 00:33:43.980
Move your bodies! Let’s go!

663
00:33:44.064 --> 00:33:45.691
This is not a drill!

664
00:33:45.772 --> 00:33:47.858
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Let’s go! Let’s go!

665
00:33:47.942 --> 00:33:49.128
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What’s going on?

666
00:33:49.153 --> 00:33:50.272
I thought we had seven days.

667
00:33:50.318 --> 00:33:51.673
The world doesn’t end
on a schedule.

668
00:33:51.697 --> 00:33:53.382
Uh, well, we’re not ready
for any kind of deployment.

669
00:33:53.405 --> 00:33:55.050
We don’t even know
what we’re going on to do.

670
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.515
You’ll get your assignment
in the LZ.

671
00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:58.679
Stay on comms. You’ll be
contacted as soon as you land.

672
00:33:58.702 --> 00:34:00.431
Some of these guys are very
green. Do they all need to go?

673
00:34:00.454 --> 00:34:02.057
Why can’t some of them stay here
and train some more?

674
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:03.308
The research facility
is under attack.

675
00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:05.144
It’s the last lab left
studying the Whitespikes.

676
00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:06.836
If it’s lost, the war is lost.

677
00:34:16.722 --> 00:34:18.306
Reach out in space! Let’s go!

678
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.724
Commencing countdown protocol.

679
00:34:19.806 --> 00:34:21.476
One minute to jump.

680
00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:42.039
Be prepared for a drop.

681
00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:45.626
The Jumplink will drop you five
to ten feet above the ground.

682
00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:47.001
That should be fun.

683
00:34:48.335 --> 00:34:49.922
30 seconds.

684
00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:51.380
Weapons up.

685
00:34:57.137 --> 00:34:59.097
Oh, here. Come on.

686
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:01.724
Take that, and just
flip it around like that.

687
00:35:02.768 --> 00:35:04.478
Makes sense.

688
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:05.896
And that’s your safety.

689
00:35:05.978 --> 00:35:07.956
Okay. How do you know how to do
all this stuff, man?

690
00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:09.690
How are you so calm?

691
00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:11.150
Long story.

692
00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:13.195
What, are you, like,
ex-military?

693
00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:15.655
Yeah.

694
00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:17.364
Kind of a short story, I guess.

695
00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:19.284
20 seconds.

696
00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:21.202
Tuck position.

697
00:35:22.496 --> 00:35:23.664
Where are we going?

698
00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:25.373
Miami Beach.

699
00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.333
Of course
it’d have to be a beach.

700
00:35:29.545 --> 00:35:31.838
Ten, nine,

701
00:35:31.922 --> 00:35:34.422
eight, seven,

702
00:35:34.507 --> 00:35:36.385
six, five,

703
00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:39.387
four, three,

704
00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:41.681
two, one.

705
00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:43.851
Launch.

706
00:36:06.373 --> 00:36:08.601
Lieutenant, something’s wrong
with the output coordinates.

707
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.376
Should we abort?

708
00:37:05.097 --> 00:37:06.766
Dan! Dan!

709
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.864
I got you. Come on.

710
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:34.168
You got to get up. I got you.

711
00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:01.989
Welcome to Miami.

712
00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:05.449
I’m just glad Will Smith
isn’t alive to see this.

713
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:14.458
Well, I could’ve done
without seeing that.

714
00:38:14.543 --> 00:38:16.003
Well, if you think this is bad,

715
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:17.920
you don’t want to see
what happens next.

716
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:35.938
Where are they?

717
00:38:36.023 --> 00:38:37.858
Somebody find out
what the hell went wrong.

718
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.608
Romeo Actual,
this is Romeo Command.

719
00:38:39.693 --> 00:38:41.652
Do you copy me?
Can anybody hear me?

720
00:38:41.737 --> 00:38:43.612
We need the comms up now.
Come on.

721
00:38:43.697 --> 00:38:45.489
Get me someone on this radio
right now.

722
00:38:45.574 --> 00:38:47.159
Romeo Actual,
this is Romeo Command.

723
00:38:47.242 --> 00:38:49.661
Do you copy?
Can anybody hear me?

724
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:51.788
Yeah. Command, this is Actual.
We’re here.

725
00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:53.373
Some of us.

726
00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:55.000
Identify yourself.

727
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:57.085
I’m-I’m Dan Forester.

728
00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.920
Dan Forester.

729
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.050
Okay, Dan, listen up.

730
00:39:03.132 --> 00:39:04.925
I got imagery up of your team,

731
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.137
and I see that you’re a soldier,
so I’m gonna be real with you.

732
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:09.764
Whitespikes have
overrun the city,

733
00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.742
and we can’t stop them,
so we’re gonna have to clean it.

734
00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:12.768
Clean it?

735
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:14.369
A blanket bombardment
has been ordered.

736
00:39:14.393 --> 00:39:16.480
Get me an ETA on that right now.

737
00:39:16.563 --> 00:39:18.190
- On me.
- They’re going to eradicate

738
00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:20.072
every living thing
till there is nothing left.

739
00:39:21.943 --> 00:39:24.402
Wait.
They’re gonna do that to here?

740
00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:25.614
I got one problem, Dan,

741
00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:26.840
and I’m gonna need your help.

742
00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.657
Get me that map
of the lab... now.

743
00:39:28.742 --> 00:39:32.579
My research team is stranded
in a lab by your location,

744
00:39:32.661 --> 00:39:34.623
and they are surrounded
by the enemy,

745
00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:38.001
so you and your unit are now
on a rescue mission.

746
00:39:38.085 --> 00:39:40.545
And since you have experience
running CSAR,

747
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:43.047
I need you to get my team
out of there.

748
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.300
You got it, Dan?

749
00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:47.010
Copy that, Command.
Listen, everybody.

750
00:39:47.094 --> 00:39:48.677
We’re on a CSAR, all right?

751
00:39:48.762 --> 00:39:50.429
It’s combat search and rescue.

752
00:39:50.514 --> 00:39:53.349
Our destination is
this research facility.

753
00:39:53.431 --> 00:39:57.103
I need every able-bodied person
on this rooftop to follow me!

754
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.625
Okay.

755
00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:20.418
We need someone on point.
What’s your name?

756
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:21.960
- Norah.
- Norah?

757
00:40:22.045 --> 00:40:23.755
- What’s your name?
- Norah.

758
00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:25.590
- Robert Cowan.
- Cowan. Okay.

759
00:40:25.672 --> 00:40:27.675
You guys hustle up there,

760
00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:29.510
look down the street,
tell me what you see.

761
00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:30.804
- Okay? Go.
- Okay.

762
00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:39.228
DAN All right,
guys, what are we looking at?

763
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.773
Car on fire.

764
00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:43.400
A scooter.

765
00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:45.277
- No aliens.
- Copy that.

766
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.443
Let’s move.

767
00:41:07.007 --> 00:41:10.135
Romeo Command,
we have multiple KIA.

768
00:41:10.217 --> 00:41:13.054
Is there anyone left here alive?

769
00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.139
Only the research team, I hope.

770
00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:17.184
Everybody else was ordered
to evacuate.

771
00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:27.568
Guys, situational awareness.

772
00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:30.572
Eyes up, down, all around.

773
00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:33.742
You’re wasting your time
training them to be soldiers.

774
00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:36.994
I’m not. Just trying
to keep them alive, man.

775
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:41.833
Listen, you and your team seem
to be the only people out here

776
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:43.418
who know what the hell
they’re doing.

777
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:44.878
I could really use your help.

778
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.338
You try to save your friends,
you’re gonna get eaten.

779
00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:49.047
We’re Team Not Eaten.

780
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.427
Did he just say they’d eat us?

781
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.094
Yes.

782
00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:56.347
What was that?

783
00:42:04.271 --> 00:42:05.648
Romeo Command, we’re approaching

784
00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:07.610
the research facility
from the southeast corner.

785
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.193
All right,
proceed to the lab on seven.

786
00:42:09.277 --> 00:42:10.277
Copy that.

787
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:47.190
Dan, you should know

788
00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:49.608
the Whitespikes can smell blood
from a mile away.

789
00:42:50.652 --> 00:42:52.277
So be careful.

790
00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:09.085
Is that... is that one of them?

791
00:43:10.672 --> 00:43:12.297
What is he doing?

792
00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:17.429
He’s taking souvenirs.

793
00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:19.222
Uh, excuse me.

794
00:43:19.306 --> 00:43:21.266
Uh, you can’t take that
with you.

795
00:43:25.143 --> 00:43:26.271
Shh.

796
00:43:26.353 --> 00:43:28.731
This guy shushes me.

797
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:31.108
Dan. You got to see this.

798
00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:34.570
What is that?

799
00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:43.829
Command, we found your team.

800
00:43:44.873 --> 00:43:46.916
No survivors.

801
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.838
All right, Dan, I’m gonna
need you to head to the row

802
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.297
of biomedical freezers
along the south wall in the lab.

803
00:43:54.382 --> 00:43:57.092
Dan, if they left bodies behind,
they’re gonna come back.

804
00:43:57.177 --> 00:43:58.469
So you need to move fast.

805
00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:01.806
The lab director’s
office is on your left.

806
00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:04.224
- Get the hard drives.
- Copy that. You got that?

807
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:05.748
- I got it.
- This office right here.

808
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:08.146
All data, all hard drives,
everything.

809
00:44:08.228 --> 00:44:10.065
Entering the lab.
What are we looking for?

810
00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:12.233
I need
all the biological material

811
00:44:12.317 --> 00:44:15.652
from lab one, and I need those
blue ampoules from lab two.

812
00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:18.280
On me. Lab two.

813
00:44:20.617 --> 00:44:22.409
Oh, no. I see something.

814
00:44:23.952 --> 00:44:25.371
Where?

815
00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:26.998
I don’t see anything.

816
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:29.458
Guys, something’s watching us.

817
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:31.001
What? Like Whitespikes?

818
00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:33.213
- Well, duh.
- It’s moving.

819
00:44:33.295 --> 00:44:34.797
You-you don’t see it?

820
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.480
Colonel, they’re gonna
start the bombing.

821
00:44:41.554 --> 00:44:43.347
Where are these blue ampoules?

822
00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:44.806
Along the south wall.

823
00:44:44.891 --> 00:44:46.226
How many we looking at?

824
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:48.103
12, Dan. I need all of them.

825
00:44:52.731 --> 00:44:54.650
Got ’em. -All right,
ready the extraction team.

826
00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:56.168
We need to get ’em
out of there right now!

827
00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:57.695
- Yes, ma’am.
- Watch team, fall back.

828
00:44:57.777 --> 00:44:59.155
Shit.

829
00:44:59.239 --> 00:45:00.739
Cowan?

830
00:45:00.824 --> 00:45:02.659
I want you to rendezvous with me

831
00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:04.594
in the laboratory on the
seventh floor. You understand?

832
00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:06.121
Lab on seven. Copy.

833
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.132
Ladies and gentlemen,
let’s move now! We got to go.

834
00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:20.385
These bombs are
gonna drop in six minutes,

835
00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:22.387
and there’s nothing
I can do about it,

836
00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:24.639
- so you need to move fast.
- Let’s go!

837
00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:30.827
We do not want to go
out the front door.

838
00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:32.414
I’m not sure if something’s
out there or not.

839
00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:33.557
Command, we need a new exit.

840
00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:34.773
Head to the loading dock

841
00:45:34.858 --> 00:45:36.251
at the back,
and take the rear stairwell.

842
00:45:36.275 --> 00:45:38.193
South stairwell. Copy that.

843
00:47:24.384 --> 00:47:26.385
Keep an eye out.

844
00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:54.121
Uh, guys?

845
00:48:28.864 --> 00:48:30.239
That’s them!

846
00:48:31.617 --> 00:48:32.952
Contact above!

847
00:48:33.036 --> 00:48:34.871
Fire!

848
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.217
Downstairs! Go now! Move!

849
00:48:57.226 --> 00:48:58.603
Come on!

850
00:49:29.884 --> 00:49:31.302
Oh, shit.

851
00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:34.722
Oh, shit!

852
00:49:34.806 --> 00:49:36.617
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit,

853
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:38.518
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit,

854
00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:40.311
shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit,

855
00:49:40.393 --> 00:49:43.606
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,

856
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.442
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit,

857
00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:48.777
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

858
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.030
- Go!
- Oh, shit, shit!

859
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:54.324
Oh, shit!

860
00:49:55.742 --> 00:49:57.744
Move, move, move! Move now! Go!

861
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.543
Go, go! Get out of here!

862
00:50:40.163 --> 00:50:41.789
Necks or the bellies.

863
00:50:41.873 --> 00:50:44.791
That’s the only lethal part
on their body. Let’s go!

864
00:50:44.876 --> 00:50:46.293
Let’s go!

865
00:50:57.722 --> 00:50:59.639
Can anybody hear me?

866
00:50:59.724 --> 00:51:01.434
Get those Humvees on site now!

867
00:51:01.516 --> 00:51:03.619
You heard the colonel.
We need transport now. Let’s go!

868
00:51:03.643 --> 00:51:05.563
Recon, Alpha... one minute.

869
00:51:05.646 --> 00:51:07.063
We can’t afford to lose them.

870
00:51:07.148 --> 00:51:08.666
Romeo Actual, the bombing’s
gonna commence in three minutes.

871
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.068
You have got to get
out of there.

872
00:51:11.152 --> 00:51:14.070
- Bravo inbound.
- 60 seconds.

873
00:51:14.155 --> 00:51:15.322
Go weapons hot.

874
00:51:16.739 --> 00:51:18.050
All right, Actual,
you need to head left

875
00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.077
at the next intersection.
You got Whitespikes

876
00:51:20.161 --> 00:51:22.704
closing in on you
from the north and the south.

877
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:24.791
Uh, Command, we’re going right!

878
00:51:26.958 --> 00:51:29.420
Okay, but you need to stay away
from areas with red smoke.

879
00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:36.969
Contact acquired.

880
00:51:37.052 --> 00:51:38.512
Red smoke visible
at two o’clock.

881
00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:40.056
Form up on me.

882
00:51:45.643 --> 00:51:46.771
Yes! Oh, my God!

883
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.402
What the hell, man?

884
00:51:55.947 --> 00:51:56.947
Attack!

885
00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:04.539
Contact rear!

886
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.927
- Move!
- Move!

887
00:52:19.929 --> 00:52:21.806
Approaching target.

888
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:24.391
Fox one, package inbound.

889
00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:26.601
Bravo, on me. Danger close.

890
00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.503
Dan, get the hell out of there
right now. -Yeah, no shit!

891
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:07.018
Enemy’s swarming
the target location.

892
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:08.476
Bravo team, let’s hit it again.

893
00:53:08.561 --> 00:53:10.313
Move now!

894
00:53:10.396 --> 00:53:11.688
Go!

895
00:53:13.398 --> 00:53:15.192
Come on!

896
00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:25.119
1-1-5, weapons free.

897
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:33.543
Bravo 2-8 on-site, fully armed.

898
00:53:33.628 --> 00:53:35.253
There’s a shit ton of Spikes
down there.

899
00:53:35.338 --> 00:53:37.715
Friendlies on the ground,
take cover.

900
00:53:37.797 --> 00:53:39.592
Get out of there. Move now.

901
00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:41.969
We’re working on it.

902
00:53:46.181 --> 00:53:48.726
- We got to go!
- No, we can’t leave him.

903
00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:50.186
Final approach, package east.

904
00:53:50.268 --> 00:53:51.603
T minus 30 seconds.

905
00:53:51.686 --> 00:53:52.746
Colonel, they’re not
gonna make it.

906
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:53.856
Dan, what is your status?

907
00:53:59.362 --> 00:54:00.402
Let’s go!

908
00:54:02.322 --> 00:54:04.784
Dan, you are
in the line of fire.

909
00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:07.161
You have got to get
out of there.

910
00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:09.329
Goddamn it, Dan,
get the hell out of there!

911
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:11.123
- Working on it, Command.
- Go!

912
00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:12.708
Come on! Let’s go! Move!

913
00:54:12.791 --> 00:54:14.585
- Just go!
- We got this!

914
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:17.295
Go!

915
00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:27.389
800 meters. Let’s take ’em down.

916
00:54:33.018 --> 00:54:34.771
Weapons free.

917
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.324
Hey. Charlie.

918
00:55:27.407 --> 00:55:29.076
You okay?

919
00:55:43.797 --> 00:55:45.717
Jesus.

920
00:55:54.643 --> 00:55:57.271
Where the hell are we?

921
00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:59.981
Well, we’re not in Miami
anymore, that’s for sure.

922
00:56:01.317 --> 00:56:03.110
Additional personnel required

923
00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:05.152
for off-loading.

924
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.532
All personnel, clear the deck
for incoming.

925
00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:11.367
Come on.

926
00:56:13.746 --> 00:56:15.748
Hey.

927
00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:20.543
Where is everybody?

928
00:56:22.253 --> 00:56:23.880
What do you think?

929
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.302
You should’ve kept going

930
00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:32.472
instead of jumping into that
tunnel to save your friends.

931
00:56:32.556 --> 00:56:34.391
We’re here to save people.

932
00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:35.851
We got to try.

933
00:56:35.934 --> 00:56:37.561
We’re on a mission.

934
00:56:37.643 --> 00:56:38.978
That’s what we’re here to do.

935
00:56:39.063 --> 00:56:40.688
But you didn’t.

936
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.485
Did you?

937
00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:47.070
You’ll see.

938
00:56:47.152 --> 00:56:49.697
Nothing we do here matters.

939
00:56:49.782 --> 00:56:51.659
That’s where you’re wrong.

940
00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:55.871
I don’t believe that one bit.

941
00:56:55.954 --> 00:56:57.789
I don’t think
you believe that, either.

942
00:56:57.873 --> 00:56:59.333
You don’t know me.

943
00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:01.501
If nothing matters,
what are you doing here?

944
00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:03.585
Three deployments.

945
00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:07.007
Why you got that...

946
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.550
souvenir around your neck?

947
00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:10.469
It’s not a souvenir.

948
00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:13.764
It’s a reminder.

949
00:57:15.056 --> 00:57:16.266
Of what?

950
00:57:20.646 --> 00:57:24.650
Reminds me of the one thing
I learned the day I got drafted.

951
00:57:27.652 --> 00:57:30.614
I’ll be dead in six months.
Cancer.

952
00:57:31.657 --> 00:57:33.199
So here’s what I’m gonna do.

953
00:57:33.284 --> 00:57:36.911
I’m gonna keep living my life...

954
00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:39.331
the way I want to,

955
00:57:39.414 --> 00:57:42.835
and I’m gonna die
the way I want to.

956
00:57:45.588 --> 00:57:48.590
I’d rather die here
than a slow death back home.

957
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:52.552
Dan Forester.

958
00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:53.846
That’s me.

959
00:57:53.929 --> 00:57:55.431
Command wants to see you.

960
00:57:55.514 --> 00:57:58.016
You two,
you’re gonna be redeployed.

961
00:57:58.099 --> 00:57:59.601
Nope.

962
00:57:59.684 --> 00:58:01.353
I’m dead, man. I can’t...
You kidding me?

963
00:58:01.436 --> 00:58:03.105
- I can’t do this again.
- Yes, you can.

964
00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:04.581
I’m gonna get killed,
or I’m gonna kill somebody else.

965
00:58:04.606 --> 00:58:06.483
Yes, you can.-

966
00:58:06.567 --> 00:58:08.652
And you will.

967
00:58:09.945 --> 00:58:10.987
Okay.

968
00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:13.282
- Yeah.
- All right.

969
00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:16.869
Take care of him.

970
00:58:18.036 --> 00:58:20.039
Sir, we don’t have all day.

971
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.628
Okay. I can survive this.

972
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:28.005
No, you can’t.

973
00:58:28.088 --> 00:58:29.505
Well, don’t laugh.

974
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:31.568
You don’t laugh if somebody says
they’re gonna survive something.

975
00:58:31.592 --> 00:58:32.927
These have to make it

976
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.427
to Deepswell in one piece.

977
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.887
Copy that.

978
00:58:35.971 --> 00:58:37.806
Romeo Command?

979
00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:40.351
I believe we’ve met already.

980
00:58:40.434 --> 00:58:42.561
Dan Forester.

981
00:58:42.643 --> 00:58:45.981
Yes, uh, thank you
for recovering the ampoules.

982
00:58:46.065 --> 00:58:47.815
My pleasure. Yeah.

983
00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.652
And for trying to find my team.

984
00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:52.612
I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry.

985
00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:54.072
Colonel Forester.

986
00:58:54.155 --> 00:58:56.324
- I’m not a colonel.
- Excuse me.

987
00:58:56.407 --> 00:58:57.427
They’re starting in 20, Colonel.

988
00:58:57.451 --> 00:58:58.452
Copy. Thank you.

989
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:02.164
Colonel Forester.

990
00:59:02.248 --> 00:59:05.251
First Sergeant Dan Forester,
Special Forces.

991
00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:07.920
Uh, former, in a past life.

992
00:59:08.003 --> 00:59:10.505
Forester. That’s funny.

993
00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:13.884
Uh, you spell that... one "R"?

994
00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:15.635
Just one "R."

995
00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.012
Me, too.

996
00:59:17.096 --> 00:59:19.014
Wait, where...

997
00:59:20.516 --> 00:59:22.351
Where your people from?

998
00:59:24.018 --> 00:59:26.063
Same place that you’re from.

999
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.407
Muri.

1000
00:59:37.992 --> 00:59:39.952
You’re my Muri Forester?

1001
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:42.579
I’m Muri Forester.

1002
00:59:42.663 --> 00:59:44.664
Wow.

1003
00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:49.753
You got, uh...

1004
00:59:50.878 --> 00:59:52.380
Old?-

1005
00:59:52.463 --> 00:59:54.090
No, you look great. You, uh...

1006
00:59:54.172 --> 00:59:56.010
I mean, just...

1007
00:59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.514
Compared to
the last time I saw you, you...

1008
01:00:03.056 --> 01:00:05.601
Y-You...

1009
01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:07.438
I didn’t know if you were alive.

1010
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:08.896
Don’t.

1011
01:00:10.898 --> 01:00:12.318
Okay.

1012
01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:18.532
Let’s take a walk.

1013
01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.501
Colonel.

1014
01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:32.295
Colonel Forester...
gonna take me a minute

1015
01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:34.380
to get used to that one.

1016
01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:36.842
I have a few different titles.

1017
01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:38.135
I guess when you’re down

1018
01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:40.094
to less than 500,000 people
on the planet,

1019
01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:42.806
you wear a few hats.

1020
01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:46.143
I always figured you would’ve
went into science.

1021
01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:48.143
I did.

1022
01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:51.731
R-Force is my creation.
I’m the lead researcher.

1023
01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.360
Wow. Come on.

1024
01:00:54.443 --> 01:00:56.612
Yeah, I have a PhD
in biotechnology

1025
01:00:56.695 --> 01:01:00.114
with an emphasis
in genomics and immunology.

1026
01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:04.786
Cal State?

1027
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.425
Well, I hope I was proud of you.

1028
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.637
I am. I’m proud of you.

1029
01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:30.018
Look, you need
to understand something.

1030
01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:34.023
This is the end.

1031
01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:36.943
Within the next few weeks,
the human species will disappear

1032
01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.777
from the face of the earth.

1033
01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:43.534
We are literally living
on borrowed time.

1034
01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.077
So you should know that

1035
01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:47.371
nothing about this for me
is sentimental.

1036
01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:49.664
I didn’t in any way
bring you here

1037
01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:52.501
because I wanted
to spend time with my father.

1038
01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:54.420
I brought you here for a reason.

1039
01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:59.257
Well, what’s the reason?

1040
01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:04.137
I’ll tell you
when you need to know.

1041
01:02:07.931 --> 01:02:09.851
Yes, ma’am.

1042
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.442
Do you want to see something
really dangerous?

1043
01:02:17.693 --> 01:02:19.695
I feel like literally
that’s all I’ve been doing

1044
01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:21.905
since I got here, but okay.

1045
01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:25.242
What is that?
That’s not what I saw in Miami.

1046
01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:27.411
No, the ones that you fought
in Miami were the males.

1047
01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.413
This is a female.

1048
01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.039
She’s very aggressive
and much more rare.

1049
01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:33.458
They typically nest underground,

1050
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:34.976
and the males are
fiercely protective.

1051
01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.503
They would die to defend her.

1052
01:02:36.585 --> 01:02:39.465
All they seem to care about is
the survival of the species.

1053
01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:40.965
Attention!

1054
01:02:41.047 --> 01:02:42.509
Carry on.

1055
01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.510
All right, listen up, everybody.

1056
01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.054
Greenwood, this is Dan Forester.

1057
01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:47.972
He’s gonna be joining us
for the extraction.

1058
01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.681
He’s gonna need full armor.

1059
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.976
The toxin kills the males
just fine.

1060
01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:53.619
It makes quite a mess of them,
actually.

1061
01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:55.731
But when we sent a team in
to clean out the nests,

1062
01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:59.358
we found dozens of dead males
and her.

1063
01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:01.652
So the females
survive the toxin.

1064
01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:03.505
And now you want to find out
why it didn’t kill her?

1065
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.324
In order to find out what can.

1066
01:03:06.407 --> 01:03:07.760
Vipers Two, Three and Four
are ready

1067
01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.077
to sedate and cage the female.

1068
01:03:09.161 --> 01:03:11.371
Greenwood and I will provide
recon and air support.

1069
01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:14.373
- Got it? Any questions?
- No, ma’am.

1070
01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:17.793
Her physiology is the key
to their extinction.

1071
01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:19.713
It’s kind of our last hope.

1072
01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:22.132
Last hope for what?

1073
01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:25.802
At finding something
that will kill them all.

1074
01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:28.679
Okay. We’re in and out
real quick. Let’s go.

1075
01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:03.172
They’re everywhere.

1076
01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:05.717
Yeah, one day,
they were just here.

1077
01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:11.097
They were stealthy.

1078
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.641
They landed somewhere remote,

1079
01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:14.684
avoided all satellite imagery
and radar.

1080
01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:17.853
They started
tearing apart Russia.

1081
01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:20.065
Three years later,
every major landmass...

1082
01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.983
North and South America,
Australia,

1083
01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:24.570
Asia, Africa, Europe...
are devoid of human life.

1084
01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.739
Three years. I mean, they must
be reproducing so fast.

1085
01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:29.907
They have no use
for prisoners or government,

1086
01:04:29.992 --> 01:04:32.661
technology, money... nothing.

1087
01:04:34.288 --> 01:04:36.498
We are food.

1088
01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.708
And they are hungry.

1089
01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.222
Muri, when they gave me this...

1090
01:04:53.806 --> 01:04:55.309
...they said, uh...

1091
01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.478
...they said I’d die
in seven years.

1092
01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:06.777
Yeah, last time I saw you
was the day that you died.

1093
01:05:10.364 --> 01:05:12.367
It’s like seeing a ghost.

1094
01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.788
What happened?

1095
01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:21.293
What happened? Like...

1096
01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:22.960
how-how did you die?

1097
01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:24.463
No.

1098
01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:27.547
What happened before I died?

1099
01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:30.802
What happened to me?

1100
01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:34.556
Wh... You know,
what happened to your mom?

1101
01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:40.436
I think the less that we say
to each other, the better.

1102
01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.862
Ranger Team One,
Viper Five coming topside.

1103
01:05:57.663 --> 01:05:59.581
Has the female been sedated?

1104
01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:03.251
We’re throwing
everything we can at her.

1105
01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:06.128
Fire team has her cornered.

1106
01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:07.963
She’s in Cave One.

1107
01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:09.757
We tranqed her pretty hard.

1108
01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.135
She’s fighting it,
but she’s feeling it.

1109
01:06:12.219 --> 01:06:13.679
We could use some help

1110
01:06:13.762 --> 01:06:15.639
- getting her in the cage.
- Roger. Rope.

1111
01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.536
Keep pulling!

1112
01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:41.498
Got to fight.

1113
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:53.467
Come on.

1114
01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:22.914
Man down! Man down!

1115
01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:24.750
All right, take it down
and give me cover.

1116
01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:26.418
- We’re going in.
- Yeah, I need a gun.

1117
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:28.253
No, you’re staying in the helo.
You’re up.

1118
01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:49.815
Go, go, go!

1119
01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.452
Someone get a harpoon
on that tentacle!

1120
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:06.666
R Team, incoming, Cave Two!

1121
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.001
Fire in the hole!

1122
01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:40.283
Get ready.

1123
01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:42.661
I’m about to piss her off.

1124
01:08:47.163 --> 01:08:49.251
Greenwood, now!

1125
01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.760
Pull!

1126
01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.764
- Pull her in the cage!
- Do it now!

1127
01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.198
The colonel is down.

1128
01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.953
I repeat, the colonel is down!

1129
01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.412
Stay in the helo.

1130
01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:04.826
Hang on!

1131
01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:13.207
Now!

1132
01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.170
Come on, pull!

1133
01:10:46.783 --> 01:10:48.368
We got her ass.

1134
01:10:51.663 --> 01:10:54.626
Viper One, get her out of here.
We’ll get the next one.

1135
01:10:57.045 --> 01:10:59.756
Viper Four, enemy contact...
your three o’clock!

1136
01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:05.551
Run!

1137
01:11:24.904 --> 01:11:26.408
- Cover!
- Go!

1138
01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.608
You put yourself in danger.

1139
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:43.024
I made a judgment call.

1140
01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:45.819
Yeah, you could’ve screwed up
my mission.

1141
01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:47.904
I was trying to help.

1142
01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:50.867
That’s not what
I asked you to do.

1143
01:12:50.948 --> 01:12:52.786
I need you to stay alive.

1144
01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.328
You were under attack.

1145
01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:55.828
I wasn’t gonna sit in a helo

1146
01:12:55.912 --> 01:12:57.997
and listen to my daughter
get eaten.

1147
01:12:58.082 --> 01:12:59.501
Sorry.

1148
01:12:59.582 --> 01:13:01.127
I’m still your dad.

1149
01:13:06.506 --> 01:13:08.591
You know, I used to want
to be like you.

1150
01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.806
I wanted to be you.

1151
01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.060
I believed in you
when nobody else did.

1152
01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.854
And then?

1153
01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.692
What? What happened?

1154
01:13:24.774 --> 01:13:26.984
Talking about a period
of my life that I haven’t lived

1155
01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.194
but you have.

1156
01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:29.613
Enlighten me. What happened?

1157
01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.364
You left us.

1158
01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:33.326
Bullshit. No, I didn’t.

1159
01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:34.911
Yeah, you left us.

1160
01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.997
That nearly killed Mom,
you know.

1161
01:13:41.332 --> 01:13:43.711
She believed in you, too.

1162
01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:45.212
Just like I did.

1163
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.425
I know for a fact
I would never leave you.

1164
01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:53.761
Yeah, that’s what I thought.

1165
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:04.605
When I was 12,
you guys separated.

1166
01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:10.572
And then you told me that
everything was gonna be okay.

1167
01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:14.033
And then, when I was 14,
you divorced.

1168
01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:22.332
You never seemed happy
with your life.

1169
01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:27.046
And then, on my 16th...

1170
01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:38.765
We got a call from the hospital.

1171
01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.688
You were in a car accident.

1172
01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:51.944
I was there in the ICU.

1173
01:14:54.238 --> 01:14:57.202
I heard your last heartbeat
on the monitor.

1174
01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:00.703
I was there...

1175
01:15:00.787 --> 01:15:03.541
when everyone rushed in
and they pushed me away.

1176
01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:08.712
And I watched them shock you
over and over again.

1177
01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.510
You know, Mom had tried
to help me

1178
01:15:14.594 --> 01:15:16.804
separate from you, but I, um...

1179
01:15:16.886 --> 01:15:18.721
I couldn’t.

1180
01:15:21.265 --> 01:15:24.685
I didn’t want to,
because I wanted you to see me.

1181
01:15:27.355 --> 01:15:31.027
I wanted you to hear me.
I wanted you to...

1182
01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:34.072
to fix it and...
and save our family.

1183
01:15:34.154 --> 01:15:36.407
I didn’t want you to walk away.

1184
01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.831
And then you were gone.

1185
01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:11.609
Deepswell-9,
Viper Actual on approach.

1186
01:16:12.984 --> 01:16:15.194
Copy, Actual.
Drone escort en route.

1187
01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.626
Excuse me. I’m looking
for Colonel Forester.

1188
01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:12.127
Thank you.

1189
01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:26.350
Good morning.

1190
01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:27.850
Morning.

1191
01:17:29.185 --> 01:17:31.270
How are you holding up?

1192
01:17:31.354 --> 01:17:33.274
Oh, I’m okay.

1193
01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.569
I’m good.

1194
01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:45.368
Want to give me a hand?

1195
01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.162
Yeah.

1196
01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:50.122
Yeah, uh...

1197
01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:51.751
What can I do?

1198
01:17:51.832 --> 01:17:55.337
Uh, just grab that controller
and, uh, take her up for me.

1199
01:18:00.216 --> 01:18:02.676
It’s the top left switch.

1200
01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:05.264
Ugh. She stinks.

1201
01:18:05.346 --> 01:18:08.225
Yeah, she’s, um, secreting
something like sweat.

1202
01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.158
You sure it’s safe
to be that close? -No.

1203
01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:27.078
That’s why we sedated her.

1204
01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:30.581
Gave her 180 milligrams
of hydromorphone.

1205
01:18:30.663 --> 01:18:32.917
Did you say 180 milligrams?

1206
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.460
Per day?

1207
01:18:34.542 --> 01:18:36.921
Every hour.

1208
01:18:39.922 --> 01:18:41.466
You know, the female genetics

1209
01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:43.469
aren’t that different
from the males.

1210
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.846
The toxin still affects them,

1211
01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:50.560
but for some reason, her body is
much better at detoxifying it.

1212
01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.019
So you just got to figure out

1213
01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:53.854
what she’s using
to attack the toxin.

1214
01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:57.189
You can design an enzyme
inhibitor to neutralize it.

1215
01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:59.068
And then we can kill them all.

1216
01:19:00.109 --> 01:19:01.737
Oh, yeah.

1217
01:19:01.819 --> 01:19:03.779
The only problem is finding out

1218
01:19:03.863 --> 01:19:06.323
what’s stopping the toxin.

1219
01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.703
It can be one of
a thousand things.

1220
01:19:10.828 --> 01:19:13.332
We’ll need hundreds
of variations...

1221
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.712
...to make thousands of tests.

1222
01:19:18.627 --> 01:19:21.215
With any luck, we should have

1223
01:19:21.297 --> 01:19:24.216
a working female toxin
by the morning.

1224
01:19:26.304 --> 01:19:27.930
I scrounged up some dinner.

1225
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:31.893
Have two options:

1226
01:19:31.975 --> 01:19:34.310
veggie lasagna and...

1227
01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:35.854
veggie lasagna.

1228
01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.314
That’s how you know
you’re near the end.

1229
01:19:41.484 --> 01:19:43.569
Okay, let’s see how fast
we can denature this thing.

1230
01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:45.363
Yeah.

1231
01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:50.118
It’s gonna run a thousand tests.

1232
01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:52.497
See if we can break down
this sucker.

1233
01:19:52.578 --> 01:19:54.538
We can.

1234
01:19:54.622 --> 01:19:56.626
We can. This is gonna work.

1235
01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.296
You’re gonna save the world.

1236
01:20:05.341 --> 01:20:07.720
37% bond.

1237
01:20:07.801 --> 01:20:08.820
That could be
the inhibitor, right?

1238
01:20:08.845 --> 01:20:09.947
Yeah, it’s not a great bond.

1239
01:20:09.970 --> 01:20:11.931
- It’s something, isn’t it?
- It’s something.

1240
01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:13.809
It’s gonna have to be
a lot stronger

1241
01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:15.813
so that the female doesn’t
break down that toxin,

1242
01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:17.395
but it is a great start.

1243
01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.480
- It’s a start.
- I’ll give you that.

1244
01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.444
49% bond.

1245
01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:28.448
The Miami Dolphins ever win
the Super Bowl?

1246
01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:30.701
Do you really want to know?

1247
01:20:30.783 --> 01:20:32.203
Yeah.

1248
01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.453
56% bond.

1249
01:20:34.537 --> 01:20:36.747
What year, specifically,
and what was the spread?

1250
01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:44.046
68% bond.

1251
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.841
Jesus.

1252
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.393
Once you figure out this toxin,

1253
01:20:55.475 --> 01:20:58.060
do you have a way
of deploying it?

1254
01:20:58.145 --> 01:21:00.479
Well, I have a solution.

1255
01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:05.152
But, uh, you know, it’s not
really worth talking about it

1256
01:21:05.234 --> 01:21:07.444
until I know that this thing
works for sure.

1257
01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:09.948
Understood. Yeah.

1258
01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:12.493
You got a lot of work to do.
I’ll just...

1259
01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:14.662
I’ll make dinner.

1260
01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.457
You know, there’s another
Sabbath coming up tomorrow.

1261
01:21:21.792 --> 01:21:23.796
Yeah. I know.

1262
01:21:25.212 --> 01:21:26.797
That’s when I leave.

1263
01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:28.341
Right.

1264
01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.720
It’s a... a big day
all around, I guess.

1265
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:42.898
I want to help.

1266
01:21:44.774 --> 01:21:46.859
It’s okay. You know, it’s, um...

1267
01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:49.488
just kind of
a one-person job anyway.

1268
01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:57.953
Muri.

1269
01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:03.502
Your mom would be really proud
of you right now.

1270
01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.587
I know I am.

1271
01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:08.756
Good night, Chickpea.

1272
01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:28.694
She never quits.

1273
01:22:32.279 --> 01:22:35.033
I came down here to see
if she needed help.

1274
01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.493
I should’ve known.

1275
01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:38.203
Is that right?

1276
01:22:39.787 --> 01:22:42.332
You would know
more than anyone, right?

1277
01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:48.506
She was nine years old
last time I saw her.

1278
01:22:48.587 --> 01:22:50.006
Stubborn, but...

1279
01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:51.634
She calls it "persistent."

1280
01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:55.761
Now more than ever,
she has to be.

1281
01:22:55.845 --> 01:22:57.221
What do you mean?

1282
01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:58.765
You know, one way or another,

1283
01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:01.225
this war is...

1284
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.145
almost over.

1285
01:23:12.904 --> 01:23:14.823
Ticktock.

1286
01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:21.787
62% bond.

1287
01:23:23.288 --> 01:23:26.836
Now starting "R" sequence.

1288
01:23:26.917 --> 01:23:31.465
Range one through 37.

1289
01:23:33.466 --> 01:23:35.301
How’s it going?

1290
01:23:35.386 --> 01:23:37.011
Going great.

1291
01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:38.971
I’ve discovered
roughly 10,000 ways

1292
01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:40.890
to not achieve
sufficient potency.

1293
01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:42.350
Why don’t you take a break.

1294
01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:43.644
Let me try some of this.

1295
01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:45.060
No, I’m fine. I got it.

1296
01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:47.398
52% bond.

1297
01:23:47.479 --> 01:23:49.108
Come on.

1298
01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:52.444
Muri.

1299
01:23:55.448 --> 01:23:58.198
You don’t have to do this
on your own.

1300
01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:00.202
You know that?

1301
01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:02.453
You brought me here
for a reason, you told me.

1302
01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:05.791
I know that I have some purpose.

1303
01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:10.296
Please.

1304
01:24:10.377 --> 01:24:12.465
Tell me how I’m gonna help you.

1305
01:24:12.546 --> 01:24:14.675
30% bond.

1306
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:23.725
Okay.

1307
01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:28.063
If this toxin works,
I need you to take it back.

1308
01:24:28.145 --> 01:24:30.189
We can’t make it here.

1309
01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:32.484
We’re on borrowed time already.

1310
01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:35.279
You have the resources
and the ability

1311
01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:37.907
to mass-produce it in your time,

1312
01:24:37.988 --> 01:24:42.328
and then you can stop this war
from ever happening.

1313
01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:47.166
Muri, what are you asking me?

1314
01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:51.962
You’re asking me to save
my future, but then what?

1315
01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.131
Leave you?

1316
01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:56.759
Here, to die?

1317
01:24:58.886 --> 01:25:00.679
I know.

1318
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.393
I know what
I’m asking you to do.

1319
01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:10.523
No, there’s got to be
another way.

1320
01:25:10.604 --> 01:25:13.149
Believe me,
I’ve thought of everything,

1321
01:25:13.234 --> 01:25:15.152
and this is the only way.

1322
01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:21.408
I’m asking you to do what
no one else is willing to do.

1323
01:25:22.827 --> 01:25:24.578
Why me?

1324
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.331
Because you’re my father.

1325
01:25:28.582 --> 01:25:31.752
And there’s no one
that I want to trust more.

1326
01:25:34.837 --> 01:25:36.756
All right, Muri.

1327
01:25:36.841 --> 01:25:38.050
Okay.

1328
01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:42.261
I’ll take the toxin back.

1329
01:25:42.345 --> 01:25:44.265
I’ll have it mass-produced.

1330
01:25:44.346 --> 01:25:47.059
But understand this:

1331
01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.979
I am not going to leave you
here to die.

1332
01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:52.689
I’m coming back for you.

1333
01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:55.693
And you and me,
we’re gonna save this world.

1334
01:25:55.774 --> 01:25:57.319
Together.

1335
01:26:01.613 --> 01:26:04.451
100% bond.

1336
01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:09.413
Try R-7.

1337
01:26:26.974 --> 01:26:28.934
Shit.

1338
01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:36.817
Incoming! Incoming!

1339
01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:40.944
Oh, shit!
They breached the perimeter!

1340
01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.948
They’re surrounding us.
Listen to me.

1341
01:26:43.032 --> 01:26:44.783
They’re destroying
the perimeter defense.

1342
01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:49.787
Oh, my God, the minefield.

1343
01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:54.627
They’re coming for her.

1344
01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:14.104
I need to get this
to safety right now.

1345
01:27:14.188 --> 01:27:15.479
- No, we have to kill her.
- No!

1346
01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:17.250
This is all the toxin we have.
We cannot waste it.

1347
01:27:17.274 --> 01:27:18.649
Come on. Move! Go!

1348
01:27:20.359 --> 01:27:23.113
Eight minutes to jump.

1349
01:27:23.197 --> 01:27:25.073
I need you to do
exactly what I say

1350
01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:26.877
when I say, how I say it.
Do you understand?

1351
01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:29.578
You’re our mission now.
I have to protect you.

1352
01:27:29.662 --> 01:27:32.081
- I understand.
- You have got to make it back.

1353
01:27:32.162 --> 01:27:33.288
I promise.

1354
01:27:33.372 --> 01:27:34.375
What about you?

1355
01:27:34.457 --> 01:27:35.626
We’re getting in the chopper.

1356
01:27:35.707 --> 01:27:37.068
You can make the jump
from the air.

1357
01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:38.877
Greenwood,
I’m taking Dan to Viper One.

1358
01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:40.712
I’ll hold ’em off
as long as I can.

1359
01:27:40.796 --> 01:27:43.759
MAN All personnel,
prepare for possible impact.

1360
01:27:43.841 --> 01:27:46.386
All personnel, prepare
for possible impact.

1361
01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.435
This is Colonel Forester.
I have a working toxin.

1362
01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.439
I want my chopper on the pad
ready to fly.

1363
01:27:57.523 --> 01:27:59.439
- We’re on our way.
- I copy, Colonel.

1364
01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:01.734
This is Viper One
standing by on Pad Two.

1365
01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.292
Colonel!

1366
01:28:17.376 --> 01:28:19.752
They’ve breached
the bottom decks.

1367
01:28:19.837 --> 01:28:22.131
The only way
to the helipad is up top,

1368
01:28:22.212 --> 01:28:23.672
through the engine room.

1369
01:28:23.756 --> 01:28:24.756
Copy.

1370
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.136
Start evac
for all nonessentials.

1371
01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:28.720
Everybody else, listen up.

1372
01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.470
We need you at
your defensive positions.

1373
01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:32.305
We have got to protect
the Jumplink.

1374
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:34.935
This toxin has got to go back
on the next jump.

1375
01:28:35.019 --> 01:28:37.604
Seven minutes to jump.

1376
01:28:52.743 --> 01:28:54.828
Go, go, go! Be quick.
Straight ahead, go.

1377
01:29:02.046 --> 01:29:04.006
Six minutes to jump.

1378
01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:09.301
This is Forester.

1379
01:29:09.386 --> 01:29:11.055
We’re entering the engine room.

1380
01:29:11.136 --> 01:29:12.805
Viper One copy.

1381
01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:15.515
Be advised, we’ve
got Spikes on-site, Colonel.

1382
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.225
Watch your six.

1383
01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:53.136
Five minutes to jump.

1384
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.020
Now!

1385
01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:03.917
Four minutes to jump.

1386
01:31:08.921 --> 01:31:11.175
Move! Move! This way!

1387
01:31:11.256 --> 01:31:12.384
We’re almost there!

1388
01:31:22.019 --> 01:31:23.395
Shit.-

1389
01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:30.194
Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

1390
01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:32.237
I’m... I’m okay.

1391
01:31:32.319 --> 01:31:33.488
This is Viper One.

1392
01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.532
I can’t stay here.
Spikes are all over us.

1393
01:31:39.203 --> 01:31:40.578
Put your arm around me.

1394
01:31:43.916 --> 01:31:46.460
Colonel, meet me
at the helipad on Rig Two.

1395
01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:05.310
Three minutes to jump.

1396
01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:24.081
Mayday! Mayday!
Viper One going down!

1397
01:32:32.087 --> 01:32:33.340
I need you to move.

1398
01:32:33.421 --> 01:32:35.175
We got to get up.
We got to move.

1399
01:32:35.259 --> 01:32:36.385
Come on. On three.

1400
01:32:36.466 --> 01:32:37.636
One... Hey.-

1401
01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:40.595
One, two, three.-

1402
01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:55.444
You got to leave me here.

1403
01:32:55.529 --> 01:32:56.779
Hey.

1404
01:32:58.154 --> 01:33:00.158
We’ll just sit here for a while.

1405
01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:01.658
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1406
01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:08.207
- I’m sorry.
- Hey.

1407
01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:12.877
I’m sorry I said
all those things to you.

1408
01:33:12.962 --> 01:33:14.462
I shouldn’t have said them.

1409
01:33:14.546 --> 01:33:16.716
I was angry, and I didn’t mean
to hurt you.

1410
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.636
It’s okay.

1411
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:25.390
I’m so happy
I got to see you like this...

1412
01:33:25.475 --> 01:33:27.519
how you were when I was a kid.

1413
01:33:34.318 --> 01:33:36.484
This is how I remember you.

1414
01:33:39.279 --> 01:33:41.408
We can’t quit.
We cannot quit right now.

1415
01:33:41.489 --> 01:33:43.327
We can’t do this right now.

1416
01:33:57.881 --> 01:34:00.469
- You have to take this.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

1417
01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:02.470
I’m not leaving you.

1418
01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:04.055
No.

1419
01:34:04.139 --> 01:34:05.765
You got to leave me.

1420
01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.310
We were never going to make it.

1421
01:34:16.068 --> 01:34:19.944
You need to make sure
this never happens.

1422
01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:25.158
Yeah.

1423
01:34:29.162 --> 01:34:30.997
I love you, Dad.

1424
01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:45.095
No.

1425
01:34:58.193 --> 01:34:59.819
Hang on!

1426
01:35:00.944 --> 01:35:03.154
20 seconds until jump.

1427
01:35:10.372 --> 01:35:12.457
No. No.

1428
01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:08.305
Forester. Forester.

1429
01:36:14.394 --> 01:36:16.104
Can you hear me?

1430
01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.567
Forester.

1431
01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.069
The toxin.

1432
01:36:25.154 --> 01:36:26.363
What?

1433
01:36:28.364 --> 01:36:29.564
The green vial... where is it?

1434
01:36:29.618 --> 01:36:30.993
It-it’s in your hand.

1435
01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:33.328
We tried to get it from you,
but you wouldn’t let us.

1436
01:36:33.412 --> 01:36:36.582
We need to mass-produce this
and send it back.

1437
01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:38.210
It’ll kill ’em all.

1438
01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:40.212
The Jumplink just went off-line.

1439
01:36:40.295 --> 01:36:42.255
We can’t send anything back.

1440
01:36:42.337 --> 01:36:44.341
We can’t travel to the future.

1441
01:36:45.926 --> 01:36:47.594
It’s over.

1442
01:36:48.761 --> 01:36:50.889
Oh, Muri.

1443
01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:52.474
Lieutenant Hart,

1444
01:36:52.555 --> 01:36:53.934
please report to command now.

1445
01:36:54.015 --> 01:36:55.350
I’m sorry.

1446
01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:57.479
Lieutenant Hart,
please report to command.

1447
01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.354
I’m sorry.

1448
01:37:06.363 --> 01:37:08.154
Charlie.

1449
01:37:09.198 --> 01:37:11.117
You made it.

1450
01:37:18.542 --> 01:37:20.377
I hid.

1451
01:38:26.899 --> 01:38:28.359
Daddy!

1452
01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:36.243
I made this for you.

1453
01:38:37.287 --> 01:38:39.078
I made it
the second that you left

1454
01:38:39.162 --> 01:38:41.707
because I just knew you were
gonna come home. -Yeah.

1455
01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:46.002
I got sparkles all over my room.

1456
01:38:47.046 --> 01:38:48.965
And then that was my handprint.

1457
01:38:49.047 --> 01:38:51.716
Like, we painted
over top of my hand.

1458
01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:55.555
And look... look at
all of the glitter.

1459
01:38:55.639 --> 01:38:58.850
Mommy helped me with the words.

1460
01:38:58.931 --> 01:39:00.894
Do you like it?

1461
01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:00.412
What I’m about to tell you

1462
01:40:00.493 --> 01:40:02.831
is gonna be...
it’s gonna sound crazy.

1463
01:40:03.872 --> 01:40:05.500
She was there.

1464
01:40:05.582 --> 01:40:07.292
Our little girl.

1465
01:40:07.377 --> 01:40:09.921
She’s smart. She’s a scientist.

1466
01:40:10.002 --> 01:40:11.462
I don’t... W-Wait, I’m confused.

1467
01:40:11.546 --> 01:40:13.006
You saw Muri?

1468
01:40:13.091 --> 01:40:14.509
Yeah.

1469
01:40:14.591 --> 01:40:18.555
You’re saying you literally
physically saw our daughter?

1470
01:40:19.721 --> 01:40:21.390
We worked together.

1471
01:40:21.474 --> 01:40:22.809
On a toxin.

1472
01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:24.435
She figured it out.

1473
01:40:24.519 --> 01:40:26.520
She was gonna kill them all.

1474
01:40:26.604 --> 01:40:28.564
She was gonna save the world.

1475
01:40:31.693 --> 01:40:33.609
And, uh...

1476
01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:37.073
Hey, it’s okay.

1477
01:40:39.826 --> 01:40:42.328
Now I’ve got a solution

1478
01:40:42.412 --> 01:40:44.412
and no way to use it.

1479
01:40:45.913 --> 01:40:47.917
So we got to figure it out.

1480
01:40:49.961 --> 01:40:51.921
We got to figure it out.

1481
01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:55.006
Hey.

1482
01:40:55.091 --> 01:40:57.010
We’re gonna figure
this out together.

1483
01:40:57.091 --> 01:40:59.386
Okay.

1484
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:03.181
What do we know? We know when
and where they land, right?

1485
01:41:03.265 --> 01:41:06.728
The first attack
is in late summer

1486
01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:09.020
- in, uh, northern Russia, 2048.
- Okay.

1487
01:41:09.104 --> 01:41:11.899
So, what if there’s a whole army

1488
01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:14.984
waiting for them
when they get off their ships?

1489
01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:17.654
Yeah. But there were no ships.

1490
01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:19.423
There was no satellite footage
of any rockets, nothing.

1491
01:41:19.448 --> 01:41:20.800
They searched everything.
They couldn’t find it.

1492
01:41:20.823 --> 01:41:22.533
They had to have
gotten here somehow.

1493
01:41:22.618 --> 01:41:24.368
Exactly. All we know is...

1494
01:41:25.453 --> 01:41:27.832
...they were just here.

1495
01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:30.460
Just because
they attacked in 2048

1496
01:41:30.542 --> 01:41:32.061
doesn’t mean that’s
when they got here.

1497
01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:33.962
What if they got here
in ’47, ’46?

1498
01:41:34.046 --> 01:41:35.648
I mean, it’s
the middle of nowhere, Russia.

1499
01:41:35.671 --> 01:41:36.858
We wouldn’t have found
their ships.

1500
01:41:36.881 --> 01:41:39.344
Because we’re looking
at the wrong year.

1501
01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:44.599
Holy shit.

1502
01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.810
I got to call somebody.

1503
01:41:47.894 --> 01:41:49.788
Who are you gonna tell them
came up with the solution?

1504
01:41:49.813 --> 01:41:51.789
From me. I’m gonna definitely
say that I came up with it.

1505
01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:54.399
- I think it was your wife.
- It’s all good. It’s all good.

1506
01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:57.904
With contact
to the future now severed,

1507
01:41:57.987 --> 01:42:00.404
governments have been unable
to stop rioting

1508
01:42:00.488 --> 01:42:03.033
and looting from spreading
across the globe,

1509
01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:04.953
as most now believe that,
in 30 years,

1510
01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:08.037
humanity will be wiped off
the face of the earth.

1511
01:42:08.122 --> 01:42:09.957
Did you miss me?

1512
01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:11.792
First round is on me.

1513
01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:13.670
Yeah, no one’s gonna
stop you, huh?

1514
01:42:13.752 --> 01:42:15.755
Mm-hmm.

1515
01:42:15.837 --> 01:42:17.046
Dorian.

1516
01:42:18.091 --> 01:42:19.841
There’s still a chance
that we can stop

1517
01:42:19.926 --> 01:42:22.011
this war from ever happening.

1518
01:42:22.095 --> 01:42:24.305
It doesn’t look like it.

1519
01:42:25.346 --> 01:42:27.306
Told you it was all for nothing.

1520
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:29.394
It’s too late for heroes,
Forester.

1521
01:42:30.435 --> 01:42:32.270
I’m not a hero.

1522
01:42:34.023 --> 01:42:36.524
I was trying to save
my daughter.

1523
01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:40.572
If I got to save the world
to save her,

1524
01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:43.032
then I’m damn sure gonna do it.

1525
01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:51.082
What kind of selfish dick
doesn’t help a guy

1526
01:42:51.163 --> 01:42:53.001
save his kid, right?

1527
01:42:54.252 --> 01:42:56.337
You still got that claw?

1528
01:43:00.925 --> 01:43:04.345
Well, there is something here.

1529
01:43:06.055 --> 01:43:07.724
But it’s not sediment.

1530
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:11.978
Or blood.

1531
01:43:13.145 --> 01:43:16.564
It’s ash. It’s volcanic ash.

1532
01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:19.402
And it’s not from Russia.
It’s from China.

1533
01:43:19.484 --> 01:43:22.113
- Or Korea. Somewhere in there.
- How do you know that?

1534
01:43:22.194 --> 01:43:24.908
Oh, you want me to explain the
chemical makeup of the sediment?

1535
01:43:24.989 --> 01:43:26.198
Fuck no.

1536
01:43:26.283 --> 01:43:28.161
So, how does
Chinese volcanic ash end up

1537
01:43:28.243 --> 01:43:29.621
on an island in northern Russia?

1538
01:43:29.703 --> 01:43:31.706
You know any volcano experts?

1539
01:43:35.417 --> 01:43:37.420
Am I in trouble?

1540
01:43:37.502 --> 01:43:40.256
Martin, the lives of every man,

1541
01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:43.384
woman and child on this planet
could be saved

1542
01:43:43.466 --> 01:43:45.845
if we could just get the answer
to one question,

1543
01:43:45.929 --> 01:43:48.095
and it’s all about volcanoes.

1544
01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:49.974
I knew this would happen.

1545
01:43:50.056 --> 01:43:53.100
Oh, I would’ve killed for a
moment like this in high school.

1546
01:43:53.185 --> 01:43:55.145
How would a creature

1547
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.564
who’s only ever stepped foot
in northern Russia

1548
01:43:57.649 --> 01:44:00.693
get volcanic ash from China
or Korea under its claws?

1549
01:44:00.777 --> 01:44:05.738
Well, this would be weird,
but...

1550
01:44:05.823 --> 01:44:08.576
it would have to be from
the Millennium Eruption.

1551
01:44:08.658 --> 01:44:09.953
The Millennium Eruption.

1552
01:44:10.036 --> 01:44:11.412
What the hell is that?

1553
01:44:11.496 --> 01:44:14.038
The Changbai volcano
on the border

1554
01:44:14.122 --> 01:44:17.710
of China and Korea
erupted in 946 A.D.

1555
01:44:17.792 --> 01:44:21.421
with the force of over
a thousand nuclear bombs.

1556
01:44:21.506 --> 01:44:23.131
It blew ash over half the world,

1557
01:44:23.216 --> 01:44:26.260
and today, you can still find
that ash buried in ice.

1558
01:44:26.344 --> 01:44:27.636
Is there any way to pinpoint

1559
01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.572
exactly where in Russia
that ash would’ve landed?

1560
01:44:29.595 --> 01:44:31.140
Laptop.

1561
01:44:33.059 --> 01:44:34.519
I love this kid.

1562
01:44:37.354 --> 01:44:39.064
Thanks.

1563
01:44:42.402 --> 01:44:44.153
Check this out.

1564
01:44:44.237 --> 01:44:46.072
This is the largest glacier
in Russia.

1565
01:44:46.154 --> 01:44:48.448
Scientists doing
deep drill experiments there

1566
01:44:48.533 --> 01:44:51.452
found volcanic ash
at a depth of 400 meters,

1567
01:44:51.536 --> 01:44:54.578
a depth consistent
with the average snowfall

1568
01:44:54.662 --> 01:44:57.000
since the year 946 A.D.

1569
01:44:57.082 --> 01:44:59.210
But to get ash
in the claws, I mean,

1570
01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:02.171
they would have to dig through
a thousand years of ice.

1571
01:45:03.421 --> 01:45:05.341
They didn’t dig down.
They dug up.

1572
01:45:05.425 --> 01:45:07.051
That’s why there’s
no sign of impact.

1573
01:45:07.135 --> 01:45:09.345
They’ve been here
the whole time.

1574
01:45:10.386 --> 01:45:12.849
Why wait a thousand years
to dig out?

1575
01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:16.019
Martin, can you bring up an
ice melt projection for Russia?

1576
01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:20.229
Yeah, polar ice melt, uh,
Russia, 2023 to 2048.

1577
01:45:20.314 --> 01:45:21.480
There it is.

1578
01:45:21.564 --> 01:45:22.817
They didn’t wait it out.

1579
01:45:22.899 --> 01:45:25.069
They thawed out.

1580
01:45:28.279 --> 01:45:30.198
We have to get to Russia.

1581
01:45:30.283 --> 01:45:33.118
No. You’re not going to Russia.

1582
01:45:33.202 --> 01:45:35.662
- But that’s where they are.
- Well, we think.

1583
01:45:35.747 --> 01:45:37.832
No, we know.
That has to be where they are.

1584
01:45:37.913 --> 01:45:39.250
Have any proof?

1585
01:45:39.332 --> 01:45:40.792
We have to go there
to get the proof.

1586
01:45:40.877 --> 01:45:43.755
Listen, if we can go there now
and kill them all,

1587
01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:45.877
we prevent this from ever
happening, you understand?

1588
01:45:45.921 --> 01:45:48.176
We’ve lost all contact
with the future, Forester.

1589
01:45:48.259 --> 01:45:50.319
President just placed
the armed forces on high alert.

1590
01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:52.220
They’re rioting at the border.

1591
01:45:52.305 --> 01:45:54.849
Buenos Aires, Johannesburg,
Mexico City,

1592
01:45:54.930 --> 01:45:56.850
Istanbul, London.

1593
01:45:56.934 --> 01:45:58.560
NATO’s disbanded.

1594
01:45:58.644 --> 01:46:01.645
And-and you want me to use
taxpayer money

1595
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:05.399
to fund a special covert mission
into a hostile sovereign nation,

1596
01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:07.487
led by a biology teacher?

1597
01:46:07.569 --> 01:46:10.238
Oh, also the head of R and D
for a tech company.

1598
01:46:10.323 --> 01:46:12.742
Wallace Technology... we’re
the Amazon of earth sciences.

1599
01:46:12.823 --> 01:46:15.243
I can tell I’m not
convincing you at all. That’s...

1600
01:46:15.328 --> 01:46:18.037
Look, guys...

1601
01:46:18.122 --> 01:46:20.582
the way things are going,

1602
01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:22.835
we’ll be lucky if we don’t
kill each other off

1603
01:46:22.917 --> 01:46:25.296
long before the aliens get here.

1604
01:46:25.377 --> 01:46:27.340
Excuse me.

1605
01:46:27.421 --> 01:46:29.550
Well, I hate to say
I told you so,

1606
01:46:29.634 --> 01:46:31.594
but people just hate
spending money on research.

1607
01:46:31.676 --> 01:46:34.011
I say we just go kill ’em
ourselves. How about that, huh?

1608
01:46:34.095 --> 01:46:35.640
No, Russia’s closed its borders.

1609
01:46:35.721 --> 01:46:37.809
I mean, we need a plane
and a pilot willing to commit

1610
01:46:37.890 --> 01:46:39.577
an international felony,
whatever that’s called.

1611
01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.938
There’s no way we can get there.

1612
01:46:44.148 --> 01:46:46.274
There may be a way.

1613
01:46:59.203 --> 01:47:01.122
So, how was the future?

1614
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.417
Miami Dolphins still suck?

1615
01:47:04.502 --> 01:47:06.462
I need a plane.

1616
01:47:06.546 --> 01:47:08.756
And a pilot.

1617
01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.134
To fly undetected
into Russian airspace

1618
01:47:11.216 --> 01:47:15.095
so I can get a team of soldiers
to the top of a glacier island

1619
01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:17.180
in order to find...

1620
01:47:18.806 --> 01:47:20.810
...an alien spaceship.

1621
01:47:23.104 --> 01:47:25.104
Wow, you know,
they say kids never come by

1622
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:27.189
unless they need something.

1623
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:30.903
I need your help.

1624
01:47:33.529 --> 01:47:35.158
I’ll get my coat.

1625
01:47:38.618 --> 01:47:40.537
Thank you for coming.

1626
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:44.417
Yeah. We made as much
of the toxin as we could.

1627
01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.877
- I hope it’s enough.
- Me, too.

1628
01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:49.255
I worked with Colonel Forester.

1629
01:47:49.337 --> 01:47:51.297
She was your daughter, right?

1630
01:47:52.341 --> 01:47:53.634
Yeah.

1631
01:47:53.716 --> 01:47:56.011
It was an honor
to have known her.

1632
01:48:01.225 --> 01:48:02.310
And four.

1633
01:48:15.573 --> 01:48:17.533
Our man brought
the whole arsenal.

1634
01:48:17.617 --> 01:48:18.743
Yeah.

1635
01:48:18.826 --> 01:48:21.871
’Cause this time,
I’m not gonna hide.

1636
01:48:24.457 --> 01:48:25.582
I’m gonna fight.

1637
01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:27.251
It’s not even loaded.

1638
01:48:27.335 --> 01:48:28.711
It-it’s not loaded.

1639
01:48:28.792 --> 01:48:29.792
It’s a pressurized cabin.

1640
01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:31.380
Why would I load it
in the cabin?

1641
01:48:31.462 --> 01:48:33.622
A bullet goes in the thing,
and everybody’s sucked out.

1642
01:48:37.345 --> 01:48:39.720
Dropping to 1,000 feet.

1643
01:48:41.265 --> 01:48:43.350
Okay, guys,
so we’re looking for, like,

1644
01:48:43.434 --> 01:48:44.769
geothermic anomalies, okay?

1645
01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:48.064
Anything weird,
like fissures, heat plumes

1646
01:48:48.145 --> 01:48:49.814
or magnetic spikes.-

1647
01:48:49.899 --> 01:48:53.234
Let’s grid up and cover this
part of the glacier by sundown.

1648
01:48:53.319 --> 01:48:55.988
We’ll start with
the southeastern quadrant.

1649
01:49:14.046 --> 01:49:16.006
We’ll gain a good vantage point

1650
01:49:16.091 --> 01:49:18.551
if we can get to the peak
of the ice cap before sundown.

1651
01:49:29.395 --> 01:49:31.480
Might as well be
looking for an ice cube.

1652
01:49:35.444 --> 01:49:37.697
Approaching
the northwestern quadrant.

1653
01:49:37.779 --> 01:49:41.198
Looks rough up ahead.
Watch your visibility.

1654
01:50:01.554 --> 01:50:03.470
Are your gauges acting up?

1655
01:50:03.555 --> 01:50:05.015
Yeah.

1656
01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:07.768
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1657
01:50:19.572 --> 01:50:21.698
Feel that?

1658
01:50:21.782 --> 01:50:24.283
Yeah, it’s like
something electrical.

1659
01:50:26.412 --> 01:50:28.037
Something.

1660
01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:36.587
Whoa. Look at that.

1661
01:50:36.671 --> 01:50:39.216
We sitting on a magnetic field
or something?

1662
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.091
This is a giant block of ice.

1663
01:50:42.345 --> 01:50:44.261
Anything, like,
magnetically charged

1664
01:50:44.345 --> 01:50:46.640
would be at least
a thousand feet down.

1665
01:51:04.867 --> 01:51:07.453
I think we found your ice cube.

1666
01:51:07.536 --> 01:51:08.871
Going hot.

1667
01:51:15.086 --> 01:51:17.837
Is that it?-

1668
01:52:38.002 --> 01:52:42.171
So you’re telling me
all this is melting in 30 years?

1669
01:52:42.256 --> 01:52:43.756
Well, one degree
is the difference

1670
01:52:43.841 --> 01:52:45.509
between ice and water.

1671
01:53:41.148 --> 01:53:42.983
Okay, well...

1672
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:46.362
...at least we have proof.

1673
01:53:46.444 --> 01:53:49.448
We go in there, there’s
a chance we don’t come out.

1674
01:53:50.489 --> 01:53:52.033
We can leave right now.

1675
01:53:52.117 --> 01:53:54.161
Go back with photographs,

1676
01:53:54.243 --> 01:53:57.037
show everybody the world has
a common enemy to fight.

1677
01:53:57.122 --> 01:53:58.541
Absolutely.

1678
01:53:58.622 --> 01:54:00.207
Go tell the U.N.,

1679
01:54:00.292 --> 01:54:02.336
and they can talk about it
till we’re all dead.

1680
01:54:02.417 --> 01:54:06.131
Yeah. I mean, I hate to agree
with Conspiracy Santa,

1681
01:54:06.215 --> 01:54:08.634
but, you know, we get
the world governments involved,

1682
01:54:08.716 --> 01:54:10.636
it could turn into a nightmare.

1683
01:54:10.719 --> 01:54:12.261
Yeah.

1684
01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:14.139
I don’t have that kind of time.

1685
01:54:14.221 --> 01:54:15.681
Neither does Muri.

1686
01:54:15.765 --> 01:54:18.100
Feel like this is
my opportunity to give her

1687
01:54:18.185 --> 01:54:20.435
and give this world
a second chance.

1688
01:54:22.314 --> 01:54:25.524
Second chances are
really hard to come by.

1689
01:54:34.993 --> 01:54:36.953
So, what are we gonna do?

1690
01:54:37.037 --> 01:54:39.247
I guess we’re gonna cut
that son of a bitch open

1691
01:54:39.331 --> 01:54:41.582
and shoot anything
that looks sideways at us.

1692
01:54:51.176 --> 01:54:53.095
Guys.

1693
01:54:53.176 --> 01:54:55.095
You’re secondary perimeter.

1694
01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:57.431
If we don’t come out
and something else does,

1695
01:54:57.515 --> 01:54:58.934
it cannot leave this cave.

1696
01:54:59.018 --> 01:55:00.225
You understand?

1697
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:02.979
Roger that.

1698
01:55:03.063 --> 01:55:04.648
Good luck.

1699
01:55:59.912 --> 01:56:03.038
Looks like we found our cockpit.

1700
01:56:05.917 --> 01:56:08.420
Those aren’t Whitespikes.

1701
01:56:10.046 --> 01:56:12.591
They most certainly are not.

1702
01:56:13.841 --> 01:56:16.301
They didn’t want to land here.
This is a crash site.

1703
01:56:17.345 --> 01:56:19.139
Let’s move.

1704
01:56:56.135 --> 01:56:57.970
The Whitespikes.

1705
01:56:58.051 --> 01:57:01.055
They’re cargo.

1706
01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.056
Ready to breed, like cattle.

1707
01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:05.435
Or weapons.

1708
01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:08.689
Uh, planet-clearing weapons?

1709
01:57:08.770 --> 01:57:11.149
Yeah, but they crashed.

1710
01:57:12.568 --> 01:57:14.359
Who’s to say
Earth was their target?

1711
01:57:15.404 --> 01:57:16.947
It doesn’t matter.

1712
01:57:17.029 --> 01:57:18.548
When we’re done with them,
it’ll be like

1713
01:57:18.573 --> 01:57:19.742
they were never here at all.

1714
01:57:19.823 --> 01:57:21.577
Let’s go.

1715
01:58:09.957 --> 01:58:11.792
She did it.

1716
01:58:16.421 --> 01:58:18.801
Ikemba!

1717
01:58:18.884 --> 01:58:20.301
Go! Get ’em! Dose ’em!

1718
01:58:20.385 --> 01:58:22.304
Take the corner.

1719
01:58:41.782 --> 01:58:44.201
Charlie, James,
we got Whitespikes on the move!

1720
01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:45.868
Shit.

1721
01:58:45.953 --> 01:58:47.621
I got the entrance covered.

1722
01:58:47.703 --> 01:58:50.247
Go! We’ll get the ones
in the ship.

1723
01:58:50.332 --> 01:58:52.226
Give me that C-4. In
case one of us gets in trouble,

1724
01:58:52.251 --> 01:58:54.711
we got to blow this thing
manually, all right?

1725
01:58:54.795 --> 01:58:56.087
- No timers.
- No, no, no, no.

1726
01:58:56.171 --> 01:58:57.256
Take this.

1727
01:58:57.337 --> 01:58:59.381
As a souvenir.

1728
01:59:02.301 --> 01:59:04.595
Go save your daughter.

1729
01:59:09.184 --> 01:59:10.725
Let’s go!

1730
01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:12.185
I go left. You go right.

1731
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:14.814
We got this.
No one’s hiding today.

1732
01:59:14.898 --> 01:59:16.899
Whoops.

1733
01:59:16.984 --> 01:59:18.569
Oops?

1734
01:59:18.652 --> 01:59:19.734
Uh-oh.

1735
01:59:21.069 --> 01:59:23.323
Shit. Charlie.

1736
01:59:24.489 --> 01:59:26.118
Charlie.

1737
01:59:26.201 --> 01:59:27.703
Charlie, I need you!

1738
01:59:28.368 --> 01:59:30.706
Charlie! Charlie!

1739
01:59:30.787 --> 01:59:31.913
Charlie!

1740
01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:47.014
Charlie? Dad?

1741
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:53.478
I got contact!

1742
01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.229
Light ’em up!

1743
01:59:58.024 --> 01:59:59.609
They’re on the move!

1744
01:59:59.693 --> 02:00:01.194
Light ’em up! Fire!

1745
02:00:10.578 --> 02:00:12.287
Holy shit.

1746
02:00:12.372 --> 02:00:14.291
There’s a whole colony
down here.

1747
02:00:14.372 --> 02:00:15.751
We got to blow the ship!

1748
02:00:19.252 --> 02:00:20.587
I’ll hold them off.

1749
02:00:23.841 --> 02:00:25.969
Blow the ship!

1750
02:00:26.051 --> 02:00:27.220
If I’m gonna die...

1751
02:00:30.555 --> 02:00:33.769
...I’m gonna die my way!

1752
02:00:52.287 --> 02:00:54.997
Dad? Charlie?

1753
02:00:55.082 --> 02:00:56.875
You all right?

1754
02:00:56.957 --> 02:00:58.210
You okay?

1755
02:00:58.292 --> 02:00:59.461
I got one!

1756
02:00:59.542 --> 02:01:00.837
Yeah, you did.

1757
02:01:00.921 --> 02:01:03.006
He sliced it up
like Julia Child.

1758
02:01:03.090 --> 02:01:04.716
One got away, though.

1759
02:01:05.759 --> 02:01:07.886
Big one. Red belly.

1760
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:09.386
Oh, shit.

1761
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:10.930
That’s the female.

1762
02:01:11.014 --> 02:01:12.724
We better go get her

1763
02:01:12.806 --> 02:01:16.185
before she lays an egg
or whatever the hell they do.

1764
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:24.569
Come on, look at you.
Your hands are shaking.

1765
02:01:24.653 --> 02:01:25.944
I’m fine.

1766
02:01:26.029 --> 02:01:27.779
No, you’re gonna be
a liability out there.

1767
02:01:27.863 --> 02:01:29.864
I need you to stay here,
stay with Charlie.

1768
02:01:29.948 --> 02:01:31.783
You don’t have to babysit me.

1769
02:01:31.868 --> 02:01:33.912
This is the one thing
I’m good at.

1770
02:01:40.127 --> 02:01:43.546
Aim for the left ridge.
Mind the horizon.

1771
02:01:43.630 --> 02:01:45.547
We only get one shot at this.

1772
02:02:03.859 --> 02:02:05.859
Dan.

1773
02:02:05.944 --> 02:02:08.363
I found something.
I got tracks here.

1774
02:02:10.198 --> 02:02:11.489
Dad, she’s on the move.

1775
02:02:13.827 --> 02:02:15.703
Dad, Dad, do you copy?

1776
02:02:26.421 --> 02:02:28.759
Surprise, dumbass.

1777
02:02:53.908 --> 02:02:55.408
- Move!
- Moving.

1778
02:03:02.917 --> 02:03:04.502
- Yeah, she didn’t like that.
- Get her!

1779
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:24.354
Where the hell is she?

1780
02:03:28.024 --> 02:03:29.653
Goddamn it.

1781
02:03:32.279 --> 02:03:34.489
You stuck her, Dad.

1782
02:03:35.533 --> 02:03:36.908
Back-to-back.

1783
02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:45.792
Got eyes on her?

1784
02:03:45.877 --> 02:03:47.420
No.

1785
02:03:49.756 --> 02:03:51.006
She’s bleeding, though.

1786
02:03:51.091 --> 02:03:52.801
Maybe she’s down.

1787
02:03:52.884 --> 02:03:55.051
No, she ain’t down.

1788
02:03:56.555 --> 02:03:58.515
You stuck her, though.
You got her, Dad.

1789
02:05:18.511 --> 02:05:20.430
Come here.

1790
02:05:23.306 --> 02:05:24.684
Hey.

1791
02:05:31.064 --> 02:05:32.567
I’m sorry, son.

1792
02:05:32.649 --> 02:05:33.859
No.

1793
02:05:33.944 --> 02:05:36.613
- No, no, no, Dad.
- I’m sorry for...

1794
02:05:36.694 --> 02:05:37.863
everything.

1795
02:06:19.447 --> 02:06:21.198
Die!

1796
02:06:22.742 --> 02:06:23.952
Die!

1797
02:06:53.023 --> 02:06:55.317
Did you tell it to die?

1798
02:06:56.359 --> 02:06:57.694
Yeah.

1799
02:06:59.694 --> 02:07:01.363
It worked.

1800
02:07:03.783 --> 02:07:05.783
Why didn’t you tell it sooner?

1801
02:07:12.542 --> 02:07:14.292
Yeah.

1802
02:07:14.377 --> 02:07:16.546
Let’s just take a little break.

1803
02:07:26.095 --> 02:07:27.765
Some incredible
images coming out

1804
02:07:27.849 --> 02:07:29.475
That’s right, Gabrielle.

1805
02:07:29.559 --> 02:07:31.519
An explosion rocked
a glacier there,

1806
02:07:31.603 --> 02:07:33.523
and top government sources
are saying that it has

1807
02:07:33.563 --> 02:07:35.939
something to do with the aliens
and the future war.

1808
02:07:36.024 --> 02:07:37.399
As soon as I heard that

1809
02:07:37.484 --> 02:07:39.152
the Whitespikes might
already be here,

1810
02:07:39.234 --> 02:07:40.987
my actions were swift
and decisive.

1811
02:07:41.069 --> 02:07:43.573
A coalition of elite soldiers
under my sole command

1812
02:07:43.654 --> 02:07:45.573
eliminated the future
alien threat.

1813
02:07:45.658 --> 02:07:47.158
And you know what?

1814
02:07:47.243 --> 02:07:48.536
I’d do it again.

1815
02:07:55.502 --> 02:07:57.127
Dad!

1816
02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:05.886
I love you.

1817
02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:07.180
Hey.

1818
02:08:07.261 --> 02:08:08.515
You found them?

1819
02:08:08.596 --> 02:08:10.600
Yeah.

1820
02:08:10.681 --> 02:08:12.725
Yeah, we found ’em.

1821
02:08:12.810 --> 02:08:14.145
Hey.

1822
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:16.314
Chickpea...

1823
02:08:16.398 --> 02:08:18.483
I’d like you to meet
your grandpa.

1824
02:08:32.328 --> 02:08:35.250
I never told her about
our seven days together

1825
02:08:35.332 --> 02:08:39.212
nor how, in a future
that now will never happen,

1826
02:08:39.295 --> 02:08:42.296
she changed me forever.

1827
02:08:42.381 --> 02:08:45.260
I’m never gonna leave her.

1828
02:08:45.341 --> 02:08:48.555
I’ll never leave this family.

1829
02:08:48.636 --> 02:08:53.268
Because my best future,
it turned out,

1830
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:55.685
was always right in front of me.
